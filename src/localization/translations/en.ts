      'On this lunar day, you should refrain from any active actions related to Business, so it is strongly recommended to postpone all business, cancel meetings with partners, sign agreements and contracts. As in any other area of human life, the first lunar day is meant solely for planning, and only for planning. It is best to devote this time to developing a Business Plan for the next month, thinking about an overall strategy of action, carefully analyzing your real situation and finding new ways to implement your ideas related to the Business. After all, as you know, it is not the one who always goes ahead that reaches the goal faster, but the one who first chooses the best path and only then moves along it. Effectiveness does not always depend solely on spontaneity, but more on wise and fruitful planning. It is not for nothing that creative people say: “Improvisation is only good that has been prepared.” And a business can only be successful when it is approached creatively. Naturally, you should not buy or sell anything on this day. Any active actions during this period are fraught with instability, and in the worst case, emergency situations that often eventually lead to collapse.',

      "The first lunar day is like a field where you need to plant seeds. Watering or fertilizing is not required yet. The seeds of the month must first adapt to the ground. There is no need to hurry, everything should happen naturally. During this period, it is important to remain calm and positive, as any business started on the first lunar day can last for a whole month. All your endeavors may stall, and you'll feel like you're moving in circles. If a conflict breaks out today, it could last for a whole month. Whatever you do, so as not to try to change, events will still unfold in such a way that situations will reappear that provoke more and more mutual claims, which, of course, will incite conflict every time. Everything you think and do during this period will subconsciously become your life program for the entire next lunar month and it will be very difficult to change anything about it. Any attempt to “immediately” start a business on 1 lunar day will suddenly face the fact that on the way to realizing their plans, a person will constantly encounter many obstacles, dead ends, which, it would seem, will appear as if from nowhere, like hell from a box. Short strides forward will be constantly replaced, at best, by long stumbling still and, as a rule, by a large pullback. Of course, when it comes to life and death, as they say, there is no third option. But such a force majeure situation does not happen often and it develops according to completely different laws. If possible, it is best to spend the first lunar day at home, and if this is not possible, then be as tolerant as possible to the opinions of others, try not to take anything personally. Keep a sense of humor and a reasonable amount of irony that doesn't turn into sarcasm or cynicism. Remember that any of your actions on this lunar day become like a tuning fork for the entire lunar month, as if a statement about what exactly you want. The first lunar day is ideal for submitting applications. It is believed that a petition filed during this period is sure to bring the applicant good luck and a positive outcome of the case. It is believed that an application submitted during this period will definitely receive a positive response: the outcome of the case will be very successful for you. It is time for bright hopes, bold plans, lofty dreams, and good beginnings. Think only of good things. Actively profess “non-resistance to evil with violence”. Control your thoughts, avoid negativity. Remember your childhood, recall the brightest episodes of your carefree school and student life. Plan things for the month. The first day of the lunar cycle is favorable for making any plans, except plans for revenge. Make your motto the proverb: “Don't dig a hole for someone else, or you'll fall into it yourself.” Forgive insults not only to friends but also to enemies. Of course, not everyone can do this, because it requires courage and a certain spiritual maturity. However, it is easier to forgive people on the first lunar day than at other times in the cycle. An active social life is contraindicated. On the first lunar day, it is especially tiring: it will take a lot of energy. Try not to receive guests or visit, do not communicate with a large number of people. Find the strength and courage to finally stop communicating with annoying, useless and simply bad people. Try to turn 1 lunar day into a quiet holiday where you can finally be alone with yourself or close friends. This day is good for working on the land. It's good to devote it to gardening or just get out into nature. If this is not possible, then at least walk barefoot on the grass.",
    dreams:
      'The dreams of this lunar period reflect what will happen to you throughout the lunar month, but you need to be careful not to fall into fatalism, because these dream images are, in a sense, only sketches, sketches of future events - some will happen, some will not, some will happen, but not so. Dream images on the first lunar day are the potency of possible events, a grain that may or may not grow. Think of everything you see in your dreams as some kind of “reference points”, coordinates relative to which the events of this lunar month will develop. How to interpret them correctly will depend on the correctness of the chosen direction of life.',
    esoterics:
      'In esoteric terms, the first lunar day, according to Tibetan mystical tradition, is the best time to make offerings to your guru, teacher, saint, as well as to make donations to temples and churches. The first lunar day is also favorable for taking vows related to any spiritual accomplishments, for example, fasting for many days and refraining from eating or speaking. This day is good for planning your spiritual activities, for preparing a program of yoga classes and other religious and spiritual practices.',
    health:
      'Be careful, now your body is completely unprotected, so there is a high probability of getting any injury or getting sick. When adjusting to the new lunar month, the body spends most of its energy on accurately “adjusting” the internal rhythms to the rhythms of the entire Cosmos, and as a result, neither the human physical body nor the psyche are ready for any stress. It is best to spend this day in peace and relaxation. In summer, this is the perfect time to walk in the woods or relax on the shores of a lake, river or sea.',
    sex: "On the first lunar day, sex should be avoided whenever possible. The body, as mentioned above, is in a state of self-correction, so any intervention will result in an error in setting up your biocomputer. During this period, the hormonal system adjusts, and sexual contact, as you know, is a very strong surge in hormones that prevents the body from smoothly entering a new time period. Sex on the first lunar day can lead to serious genital ailments, which in turn will increase the aging process. Because, according to Eastern wisdom, a person is healthy as long as his sexual side of life is healthy. That is why the first lunar day is a “time to love” and not a “time to make love”. The period of the first lunar day is best suited for talking about sex and its details. Tell each other about your erotic fantasies and dreams, about any fears and doubts, if any. This is very useful because it teaches partners to trust each other. If lovers establish a trusting relationship and learn to share their most secret sexual dreams with each other, they will incredibly expand the palette of their love games. Do not be afraid to talk about sex, because the sexual manifestation of human nature is multidimensional and how happy your life is in general depends on how well and harmoniously your sexual intercourse is. You also need to remember that a couple who do not know each other's sexual preferences and habits are doomed to a lot of trouble that can destroy any, even the most emotional relationship. Recently, more and more psychologists and sex therapists recommend holding such conversations from time to time. This allows lovers to relax more, relax, relieve mental stress, and most importantly, free themselves from energy blocks.",
    wedding:
      "Since the first lunar day is the time for planning, it is best to refrain from marrying during this period. The most sensible thing is to once again weigh the pros and cons of such an important and important event and consider whether your Marriage is a whim, whether you really love each other. This lunar day gives lovers another chance to find out how they fit together in terms of living together. Family life is not only flowers and gentle cooing, but also harsh family life. Luna suggests trying to plan your future life, as it were, imagine an ordinary family day when all the courtship and all the “honey” delights are over. What will the couple's day be filled with? How are they going to live? What are they going to have in common? Detailed planning of future married life will help to subsequently avoid unexpected disappointments, which, as you know, lead to divorces. Conversely, the more you plan your life together, the more reliable and stable your family's “ship” will be in the ocean of everyday life. For those who have already applied to the registry office, the first lunar day is ideal for planning the wedding itself, deciding where it will take place, how many guests there will be, how much money to save, and so on and so forth.",

      "The 2nd lunar day is designed to find sources of funding - whether it's finding sponsors or withdrawing money. During this period, it is good to conclude deals, sign contracts and agreements, that is, take actions that will help your business plans to be implemented correctly in the future. On the way to realizing what you want, you need to take a confident step forward, but without pressure and unnecessary aggression. After the first step, you need to take a short break. This is the best time to start implementing the company's new policy and carry out internal organizational measures that will make work more efficient. The second lunar day is good for hiring new employees, because in this case they have every chance to harmoniously join an already established team, and bosses, as they say, “will have to go to court”. A person who is hired on the second lunar day usually brings “fresh air” to the team and takes work to a new level. For those who are professionally engaged in business, during this lunar period it is extremely useful to give a charitable act, act as a philanthropist or sponsor, for example, a creative evening or an art exhibition. The fact is that during the second lunar day, the law is especially effective: “The more you give, the more you get.”",

      "This lunar day is designed so that you can start implementing everything you have planned on the first lunar day. At this point, you get everything you need to make your plans and dreams come true. Everything that appears in your life on the second lunar day “should be gratefully accepted”, because now fate sends you all the most important things for this lunar month. Everything you get is bound to come in handy in the near future, even if at first you don't think it is. Remember that the most important thing now is to “get into the stream”. Then you will not have to waste your energy, worry too much and push yourself. If you get into the flow of natural lunar rhythms, then your plan will be carried out as if by itself. You will only have to slightly adjust this process from time to time. The 2nd lunar day is the day of the first step, and the whole month will depend on how well you do it. The main thing when starting a business on the second lunar day is not to change your mind, that is, if you have planned to carry out this or that task, there is no need to doubt it, otherwise you will not succeed. For this lunar period, it is very important to maintain inner confidence both in your actions and in the correctness of your intentions. Doubt will ruin any undertaking. A second lunar day is like jumping into an unexplored abyss. You need to hold your breath, stop the flow of thoughts and immediately rush into the abyss. You had time to think on the first lunar day, and the second is for active, assertive action. Now you can't change your mind, replay or rewrite anything, even if you suddenly think you're wrong. Anyway, start implementing your “erroneous” plans, and then you will see that your doubts are just a moment of cowardice. A lot depends on how well you take the first step. Put aside all doubts! If you have something in mind, don't start rushing from side to side: “Did I do the right thing? Maybe it wasn't necessary?..” If you torment yourself in this way and torment your soul with doubts, you will not succeed. It is very important to maintain internal confidence that both intentions and actions are right. In other words, your hand must be firm and not flinch anywhere. The 2nd lunar day is the time for any undertakings, no matter what area of activity it concerns. You can start any activities. Social influence Today it is very good to start large educational programs, start studying new subjects and exploring new fields of science. It's good to take office on this day. The influence of mystical Signs Despite the favorable nature of this period, many magical schools warn against performing funeral rites. It is believed that you should not start with a funeral on the 2nd lunar day. Remember that this day determines the entire lunar month: where it begins, how it will end! And sorcerers warn that on the 2nd lunar day you should not do anything important between midnight and 3 a.m. It is better to sleep at this time, and if you have to stay awake, you should take precautions. The fact is that this time period is extremely unstable in energy flows, so we can expect anything. If you are active, use it to learn and learn something. You can start doing regular morning exercises if you used to neglect it. Unlike physical activity, emotional activity is still contraindicated. On the 2nd lunar day, avoid conflicts, turbulent family scenes, and showdowns. Try to be generous and open-hearted. Nutrition The second lunar day is good for fasting, establishing a proper diet. It's good to start an exercise cycle on this day. Emotional influence On this day, you should not indulge in anger; you should avoid conflicts and outbursts of emotions. The day is conducive to greed, so we need to develop generosity in every possible way and not regret what we are freeing ourselves from. On this day, you can determine what is good and what is bad for your body. You should mentally remember all the foods you eat. If you're disgusted with something, it's not your food. What you are attracted to is useful for you. The same goes for people — you can suddenly feel who you need to talk to and who you shouldn't.",
    dreams:
      'Dreaming during this period should be considered as a direct guide to action. Dream images will indicate the path that should be taken to accomplish a particular karmic task, especially if you really face a problem, and will become just the “key” to solving an urgent task. But be careful when interpreting, do not wishful thinking. When working with dreams, honesty with yourself is first of all important - “do not rewrite” dreams for the better, but perceive their images as they are. The human subconscious mind does not lie, but the mind is able to interpret everything towards the “ego”. If you doubt that you are able to correctly interpret your dream, then it is better to contact a specialist who will help you understand the images that have appeared to you, who will be able to professionally interpret subconscious symbols and suggest a course of further behavior. Love in interpreting dreams during this lunar period is unacceptable. In a sense, we can say that all subsequent dreams of the lunar month will be only clarifications and comments on the dream dreamed during this period, which is why its meaning is so important.',

This is an ideal period for studying Eastern healing systems and starting a short massage series. In short, the second lunar day is the time to start a healthy lifestyle. It's good to start new training complexes on the second lunar day, but the exercises should be selected so that they represent a kind of “middle ground” between exercise and relaxation. Static isometric exercises, which are based on the principle of alternating relaxation and tension, are ideal for this. The main thing on the 2nd lunar day is not to overdo it, because if you stretch the muscle or overexert it, it will take a long time to return to a normal rhythm, since the body remembers and “records” any exercise, movement done on the second lunar day, in its cells as a program for the entire next month.",

Don't be afraid to experiment, after all, good sex is creative sex and the more new it is, the better it is. On the second lunar day, it is useful to read ancient treatises - “Kama Sutra”, “Ananga-ranga”, “The Tao of Love” or modern sex textbooks. The second lunar day is the time to expand your sexual palette.",

      'The third lunar day is very productive for those who are engaged in business. Now it is very good to take some “breakthrough” measures in your field and reach new frontiers; in a sense, you can even take risks, but very carefully. In terms of Business, the 3rd lunar day should be filled with active actions, because during this period money comes only to those who “conquer” it, who not only dreams of material prosperity, but does everything possible to make their dream come true.',
    description:
      "On the third lunar day, for the first time in a month, the young Moon's crescent appears in the sky. Esoterically, his appearance symbolizes the exit of everything that used to mature inside. The moment has come when everything that was planned and started on the previous days of the lunar month finally begins to “grow” - take shape and unfold in time and space. 3rd lunar day - Among the main properties of this lunar day are assertiveness, power, a surge of energy, and even some aggressiveness. From an energy point of view, this is a very powerful day, and therefore dangerous. The energy of 3 lunar days is similar to nuclear energy. But it is known that nuclear energy can be used both for good and bad. It is for this reason that it is very important to direct your aspirations in a creative direction, for example, to creativity. Avoid negative emotions! During this period, try in every possible way to avoid manifestations of personal aggression, suspicion, cockiness, uncompromising and anger. It is better to avoid even increased suspiciousness. It is very likely that good thoughts will later yield positive results. At this time, you are energized, and therefore any of your actions can be explosive. Do not try to wish harm to someone on the 3rd lunar day: your negative emotional impulse will definitely be transmitted. But it will not be pleasant not only for the one you wish to harm, but first of all for you. Remember that hate has a direct effect on liver function. Not only will you experience negative emotions, but they will also be reinforced and amplified several times by the energy of the Moon. Thus, your own body will be very stressed, which will certainly affect your Health. And you will have to reap the benefits of this stress throughout the entire lunar month. That is why astrologers strongly recommend maintaining benevolence, tolerance and peacefulness on this lunar day. What will help you cope with energy flows? Intensive psychological and physical activity is very useful during this period. On the 3rd lunar day, it is desirable to fully devote yourself to work. You can stay up late at night to solve a problem that will benefit you. In general, this is a very useful and fruitful period: you can do a lot, and therefore you must do a lot. You now have enough strength to take on the most difficult task. If you can't even solve it, you'll at least get off the ground. The main thing is not to be afraid of difficulties! If the problem seems almost impossible, divide it into small parts. Let it turn into several small “problems” that can be solved one by one. And then you will see that the initial problem, which seemed insoluble, is also the motto of this lunar day: “Forward, forward and only forward!” will be solved: the Moon will help you and support you in any endeavors! Passivity and inactivity during this period are categorically contraindicated. They lead to the destruction of the body. If the power and energy that Magnifier gives you are not being used as intended, they are still looking for a way out, and this solution may turn against you. That is why you should not allow any laziness on the 3rd lunar day. Take action, act and act again! If, for example, you have nothing to do, then come up with something simple: go shopping (even if your refrigerator is full of food) or just take a walk - this is also useful. The main thing is to do something about yourself, otherwise all sorts of trouble can happen. If you don't direct the flow of energy in the right direction, it will control you by itself, and then the results may be the most unexpected. The third lunar day is very favorable for construction Remember that you planned on the first lunar day, and laid the foundation on the second? Now it's time to take action. Feel free to unfold your ideas in space and time: the moment has come to make your dream come true. By the way, Tibetans believe that this lunar day is ideal for starting to dig a well. Travel You can go on a trip or a business trip. And the farther you go, the better the trip will be, because the energy of the Moon will be able to fully realize its full potential. During this period, the thought process is especially active. You may come up with an original idea, a non-standard solution, in short, you will get an epiphany. I wonder if Archimedes's legendary cry “Eureka!” sounded on the 3rd lunar day? If you want to find the most innovative solution to the problem, it's important not to scatter over trifles. Concentrate on one of the most important tasks, direct all your mental energy to one goal. The 3rd lunar day is not the right time for doubts, meaningless conversations, fears and mental laziness. All these phenomena dull energy and create a block that will disturb you throughout the lunar month. If the path for the natural passage of mental energy is blocked, constant headaches may begin, which will certainly lead to a slowdown in the thought process. If in the first two days psychological recommendations were reduced to cultivating positive emotions and bright emotional impulses, then on the 3rd day you should actively combat negative emotions and dark thoughts. Intensively get rid of the negative, otherwise it will poison your soul and body. At the same time, try to actively fill the void with positive emotions and a positive attitude towards life. The period of dreams and plans is over. It's time to get down to action. On this day, even the most inert and hardest person must show energy and direct it in the right direction. If you use it unwisely, it will simply “eat” you. Passivity is fraught with major life failures. The objects of aggression in the air are primarily those who do not know how to defend themselves. Even people who are not confident in themselves today should not be afraid of life. You will definitely find the strength to fight.",
    dreams:
      'Dream images on the third lunar day show how correctly we use the energies provided by the Cosmos, that is, how adequately we meet our energy potential, and to what extent we are actualizing the potential that was originally embedded in us. Dreams during this period tell a person where his “energy” hole, which constantly “flows”, is located, and where to increase his energy potential in order to get out of this situation and raise his energy level necessary for doing new things. Look closely at your dreams on this lunar day, they can very accurately show you how to solve your problem and remove obstacles to lunar energy. All Dreams of the third lunar day should be interpreted only taking into account the movement of energy.',

This will help you balance the energy flows in your body and bring it into a more harmonious state.',

It is very good to do it somewhere in an unusual setting, for example, in the forest, on the water, in the mountains, on the plane, in the car, in the steppe, and so on. This will give your love relationship a new perspective and diversify your erotic feelings. Many ancient schools of love magic recommended using the most extravagant sexual positions on the third lunar day, as they contribute to a deeper and longer orgasm between partners. Sex during this period should be somewhat aggressive, for example, let a woman take the lead. In short, sex on the third lunar day should be more extreme, active, expansive, bright, tireless, imaginative, diverse and unusual.',

For those who dream of a quiet, measured family life, it is better for me to refrain from getting married during this period. It is also very good to celebrate unusual weddings on this day, for example, on the water, high in the mountains, and so on. In short, the third lunar day is the time for thrill-seekers.',

For example, it's good to look through magazines or brochures and note that maybe there is a machine somewhere that can facilitate your work or increase its efficiency by several orders of magnitude. The 4th lunar day is the time to rationalize your business and enterprise. It's better to do everything on this lunar day to improve your business efficiency than to lag behind the competition for a long time.

    description:
      "Since the Tree of Knowledge is the symbol of the day, it means that the 4th lunar day is the period for receiving information. It is on this day that the truth about your real situation at the moment can be revealed to you. And do you know who you're going to face? With yourself, with who you really are. The 4th lunar day, like a mirror, will show you your true face and you will not be able to hide behind any mask. Whoever you are: a successful businessman or a beggar, an athlete or a scientist, this day you will still be confronted with your real self, not your fictional “I”. That is why some consider the 4th lunar day bad, while others consider it good. It all depends on ourselves, on our way of life, on our spiritual and emotional qualities, and on our relationships with loved ones. The only question is whether we are afraid to meet ourselves or whether, on the contrary, this idea seems surprisingly interesting and attractive to us. In order not to be afraid of this meeting with your present self, it is very important to have time to draw the line between Good and Evil, God and the Devil, and unequivocally determine your place in their confrontation. The 4th lunar day is the day of choice. You can turn what you've learned into creation or destruction. And what you choose will largely depend on how the entire lunar month will “flow”. If the 3rd lunar day was given for active actions, then the 4th was given for their “consolidation”. Keep moving forward, but at the same time carefully analyze whether you have lost your way or made a mistake. All is not lost yet: you can easily fix some things and adjust your actions. And it would be better if you do it now than later, by the 30th lunar day, when you find that the whole month did not go as planned. The 4th lunar day provides an excellent opportunity to see how the world around you reacts to your actions during the first three lunar days. Most likely, you will be able to understand how harmoniously you fit into the surrounding reality. The 4th lunar day will give you the opportunity to “fit” into the rhythms of the Universe in the best possible way. You can find your own rut, understand everything that used to torment and haunt you. You will finally understand how your chosen path suits you, and whether your chosen goal is really worth striving for. The fact is that a significant part of our desires and goals that we dream of realizing are not really needed, but are simply imposed by society. When we strive to make dreams and desires that are alien to our true nature come true, we make it completely meaningless. When we chase mirages, we don't understand that we just have to go home, to ourselves, to the true realm of our spirit, our divine vocation. On the 4th lunar day, as a rule, nothing changes for better or worse: everything remains as it was. This period is stable and balanced. It is better for gardeners not to prune plants during this period, as they can be very injured. Tibetan astrologers believe that the 4th lunar day is ideal for working with wood, whether it's artistic wood carving or carpentry. According to Christian esoteric tradition, on the 4th lunar day, a person is seduced by the devil: it was on this day that Adam and Eve fell into sin. Christian schools instruct their adherents to be extremely careful about various temptations and temptations during this lunar period. Therefore, in solving important issues on this lunar day, it is better to rely not on the first impression, but on your intuition. You'll have to think a lot about yourself, your parents, your friends, and about life in general. Try to remember spirituality and the immortality of the soul. If you are used to thinking in specific categories and you are annoyed by such abstractions, then think about family and friends, how relations with them develop, and what feelings your communication causes. The concept of “case” is not very suitable for the 4th lunar day. Indulge in idleness and reflection. Pray and meditate. Spend a day talking to family, friends and relatives. Have a quiet family dinner by candlelight. But remember that heavy alcoholic libations are not welcome. If you are so active that you can't sit idly by, then do some homework. Don't make hasty decisions, especially in business. The moon warns that we are all subject to devilish temptations on this day.",
    dreams:
      'Dream images on the fourth lunar day usually indicate the possibility of temptation, that is, a dream symbolically plays the situation of a possible “fall”. By correctly interpreting the dreams of this period, you can fairly unambiguously identify those places in your life where you are most likely to “pierce”. Just remember that this is primarily about your inner spiritual world, and not about society with its material needs. In a nutshell, the dreams of the fourth lunar day will show you which side of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil you are on.',

Some healers warn that during this lunar period there is a high probability of contracting any illness, and Christian mystics generally advise to refrain from sex during this period.',

It is even possible that partners in such a marriage will often cheat on each other, and their marital happiness will always be on the verge of collapse. On this lunar day, lovers should once again weigh the pros and cons of their union.',

      'On the fifth lunar day, people who are engaged in Business are advised to make some fundamental changes within their company, for example, change their business concept, change their office, and so on. All things aimed at improvement and transformation will be especially successful during this period. The fifth lunar day is also good for making repairs, updating equipment, for example, upgrading (updating) a computer, changing the management style and the overall approach to the material and economic base of the entire Business. Do not be afraid to make new attempts, but remember: this is not a day of discovering new horizons by breaking forward, but a day to delve deeper into existing situations and circumstances by transforming your consciousness and changing the way you do business.',

      "The fifth lunar day is one of the most important in the first lunar phase, as it is a day of transformation and inner change. In a sense, we can say that this is the turning point of the first half of the lunar month, since it is at this time that everything done over the previous four lunar days passes into tangible, material form. On this lunar day, you need to be especially attentive to all your actions, thoughts, and actions. Everything that is thought of on the 5th lunar day is sure to find its real embodiment. It is not by chance that the unicorn was chosen as a symbol of this day, as it means loyalty to duty and principles. According to legends, he appears in front of a person only when an important change, a significant step forward in spiritual development awaits him. The 5th lunar day is one of the most important in the first lunar phase. It is a day of transformation, of inner change. We can safely say that this is a turning point in the first half of the lunar month, since it is at this time that everything done over the previous 4 lunar days enters a tangible, material form. On this lunar day, you need to be especially attentive to all your actions, thoughts, and actions. Everything you think about today, everything you want, is sure to come true. The fifth day of the lunar month is a time of global change. Everything that will happen to you during this period should be considered as a process of turning a pupa into a butterfly. Even if it seems to you that everything is falling apart, don't despair! A doll that turns into a butterfly also thinks that it is dying, but in fact, a change is just taking place, moving to a new, better level of existence. During the period of transformation, it is very important to be able to harmonize various energy flows and balance opposites. This is the time of synthesis, the fusion of diametrically opposed phenomena of a human being into a single whole. Everything that will be given to you on the 5th lunar day should be considered as the most necessary material for your spiritual growth. And even if this material seems to you to be completely inappropriate for this situation, you should never refuse it. If you want to take a major step forward in your development, try to combine various paradoxes. Only to a person with a narrow mind and a primitive mindset do things seem disconnected. A person with expanded consciousness sees everything as a whole; he is able to understand that all things are interconnected. There are no opposites, only complements. Black and white, darkness and light are not opposing phenomena, but complementary to each other. This is noted in all spiritual teachings without exception. Do not be surprised if on the 5th lunar day you feel good, then bad, then calm, then vain. Think of these changes as natural stages in the renewal of your being. Most importantly, don't dwell on just one feeling. Try your best to keep the middle ground, and then the 5th lunar day will be the very hot tub for you to plunge into, purified and renewed. The 5th lunar day is designed so that you can take everything you have, whether it be something material or spiritual (spiritual, in particular), to a new level. You have to put everything together, and not leave it in the form of disparate things piled up in a common heap. This is the perfect time to be alone with yourself. Try to keep external contacts to a minimum. The fact is that during the period of personality transformation, some unforeseen and somewhat inadequate reactions to what is happening sometimes occur. It is very difficult and sometimes impossible to control these reactions. Why provoke people into conflicts and quarrels? It is better to stay at home or with true friends. The Tibetan astrological school, for example, believes that immorality prevails on this lunar day, all virtuous actions are doomed to failure, and actions are doomed to profanity. Many astrologers also agree that on the 5th lunar day it is desirable to refrain from energy practice, as well as from working with wood, whether it is wood carving or gardening. Everything that seems like a hindrance to you on the 5th lunar day is actually the next stage in your development. Therefore, you need to find the strength to understand this fact and use it for your inner growth. There is nothing superfluous and unnecessary during this period. On the 5th lunar day, be clear in your thoughts. Analyze the actions of others. Try to figure out who is “your own” and who is “stranger”. This way you will be able to cut off foreign influences that are alien to you. Bring your good intentions to their logical conclusion. On the 5th lunar day, you can't leave good deeds unfinished. Unfinished goods can get you into trouble. Avoid showing ill will towards people. Creative activity and perseverance in achieving goals are welcome. If you consider yourself a principled person, the Moon will be by your side. On the 5th lunar day, you will be successful in defending your ideals and principles of life. In general, any struggle for a just cause will be effective. Truth-lovers are given the green light on this day.",

      'Dreams during this period symbolically show a person the processes of his internal changes.

      "During this lunar period, complex alchemical processes take place in the body, so exercise should be more focused on inner work. It is good to work out tendons, work with energy channels on the fifth lunar day, and muscle stretching exercises are also very useful. Such a selection of exercises will help the body go through a period of internal transformation faster and without complications, because on the fifth lunar day, changes occur even at the cell level - the vibrational characteristics of the aura completely change. Moreover, even those who do nothing on this day are subject to changes, however, such changes, of course, occur with a minus sign, that is, the body is being globally destroyed. It is not for nothing that there is a saying: “If you don't go forward, you go back.”",
    sex: "Sex on the fifth lunar day should be considered as a healing, even alchemical process. He transforms the accumulated tension, stress and painful symptoms into pure energy of joy and love. Therefore, sexual positions should be chosen as simple and comfortable as possible for both partners. It is better to refrain from extravagant body plexuses and acrobatic tricks, since very important changes are taking place in a person's energy structure, and they should not be disturbed. Sex on the fifth lunar day should relax and soothe. It should have, as the musicians say, “fewer notes but more music”.",
    wedding:
      'Those wishing to marry on the fifth lunar day should be prepared for the fact that their relationship will be constantly subject to various changes, and family life will be full of rapid changes both material (constant change of housing, work, household options, etc.) and spiritual (discovering new horizons, understanding their true essence, constantly searching for new ways, etc.). Those who prefer to travel a lot and who are not at all attracted to sedentary life in one place, who are attracted to adventures and distant countries can also marry on the fifth lunar day.',

It is undesirable to “put pressure” on the events taking place in the financial sector on the sixth lunar day; on the contrary, it is better to slow them down a little and freeze them. It should be understood that the sixth lunar day is a calm, clear mountain lake, and if you stir up its waters, the consequences will be very sad: due to water ripples, you will not notice what is meant for you personally, as Carlos Castaneda said: “You will miss your cubic centimeter of luck.” Stay as calm as possible. The ideal solution on the 6th lunar day would be to rest and think about what is happening, try to analyze the circumstances and look into the future. And since on the sixth lunar day, all people have the ability to foresee, a lot of useful things can be learned from this. If you have to conduct financial transactions on the sixth lunar day, then keep in mind that during this period it is undesirable to sell anything, it is better to buy it. It is believed that selling today leads to significant losses, the money, as they say, will “float away” and you may find yourself at the very bottom, that is, go bankrupt. It is not desirable now to repay debts and repay collateral.',

      'It is not by chance that the crane was chosen as a symbol of this day: it is believed that the 6th lunar day is associated with both the elements of water and the element of air. The events of this period are as calm as the smooth flow of water and as light as air. The sixth lunar day can be considered, in a sense, adaptive after the changes that took place the day before. It gives a person the opportunity to gradually get used to himself renewed, to feel in a new “skin”. As a rule, on the 6th lunar day, there are no unforeseen events, no unexpected situations - neither good nor bad. Usually, everything happens as before, without much change. 6th lunar day - Tibetan astrologers recommend refraining from both long trips and short trips on the 6th lunar day. It is believed that this time is meant for relaxation, and traveling can disrupt the quiet rhythm of life. Such a shock can lead to unpredictable negative consequences. The Tibetan School of Astrology also does not recommend handing over personal items to anyone during this period. It is believed that the person to whom you give your things can take away your peace and luck with them: they will flow away like “water” or “evaporate” like “air” on the 6th lunar day. Think of the 6th lunar day as a time of rest, passivity, contemplation. Try to be careful and do not succumb to any provocations. Stay calm and tolerant about everything that happens. The sixth lunar day really resembles water, in which everything is reflected without lingering. You yourself will have to be light, calm, but at the same time as mobile as air. If you manage to maintain your inner balance, you will spend this time with pleasure. Think less. Do not load your mind with everyday trifles. Send your thoughts “free float”. And then you will discover truths that you have not yet been able to get to. Moreover, these revelations will not concern the sphere of higher human activity: do not expect that you will suddenly come up with a brilliant idea that will change the whole world. No, you will get answers to simple but very important questions, such as: “Loves or dislikes?” , “Is he lying or not lying?” , “Friend or Foe?” etc. On the 6th lunar day, do your daily activities in a normal rhythm, but try to get away from the bustling world. Think that work is an integral part of life, and therefore, whether you want to or not, you have to work.',

Everything you dream about during this period, even the seemingly most abstract or meaningless images, should be considered as a direct prediction or revelation sent from above. The most important thing is to interpret the dream images of the sixth lunar day correctly. But do not try to interpret the symbols of your dreams too clearly, listen more not to reason, but to the feeling that you have left after sleep. If you ask the Higher Forces a question before going to bed during this lunar period, you will definitely receive symbolic answers. But remember, the question should be specific and undefined, implying an accurate answer, and secondly, when you wake up, be sure to record the dream, because prophetic Dreams are very quickly forgotten, and a forgotten person subconsciously replaces the forgotten one with an invented or desirable one, which, of course, takes him far from the truth.',

      "It is dangerous to overstrain the vocal cords on the sixth lunar day, that is, to “tear off” the voice. Therefore, anyone who in one way or another has to talk a lot on duty should refrain from talking for a long time during this period. We should try to avoid silence as much as possible. Naturally, at this time you should also refrain from drinking cold drinks, even if it's summer outside - the respiratory tract and throat are very weak, they must be protected. For those who are actively engaged in pranayama or any breathing exercises, on the sixth lunar day, it is recommended to slightly reduce the load or at least not increase them in order to avoid undesirable complications that can end very badly. During this period, it is good to perform programs designed to rejuvenate the body. Massage will be very useful, and you should not limit yourself in choosing a massage method; you can use both traditional European and exotic ones, for example, Thai, Vedic or acupressure. If it is not possible to get a massage from a professional massage therapist, perform at least one self-massage session. This will greatly benefit you. Massages using aromatic oils, as well as the aromatherapy session itself, will be very useful.",
    sex: 'On the sixth lunar day, sexual relations should be calm, reverent and tender. If at least one of the partners is irritated or feels muscle tension, then it is better to give up sex altogether, because he will not be able to heal you, as, for example, on the previous lunar day, but on the contrary, will only cause internal discomfort. Be sure to refrain from extreme poses and sexual techniques that require active action during this period. The sixth lunar day is the time for “classic” sex with traditional positions. Let it be better not to have enough sex itself, but more tenderness, kisses, warm words and caresses. If you feel tired, but you still want intimacy, then the ideal option in this case would be just a mutual erotic massage, even with petting elements. In addition, the sixth lunar day is good for older people with poor health to have sex.',

Marriages concluded on the sixth lunar day are usually stable and peaceful, and spouses in such families are usually compliant and tolerant of each other's shortcomings. Marriages are long and rarely end in divorce.

Just remember, an argument during this period will lead to very serious consequences - a break in business relations or to darker results.

      "The seventh lunar day is marked by the magic of words. The power of words on this day increases many times, not only of a sacred word - a prayer, a spell - but also an ordinary word thrown in vain by you. That is why during this period you should be very careful about the words you say and never send curses to anyone. At this time, curses become especially effective and are sure to come true. Remember that a word is a vibration that creates a form in the invisible world. In other words, every word spoken in the astral and mental worlds becomes an absolute reality. It is no coincidence that in all mystical practices, such close attention was paid to the proper use of words, in particular, to achieving unity of thought, word and action. Any fleeting bad phrase can result in a series of big troubles for you. Moreover, your word will return not on the 7th lunar day, but after a while. You will already forget that on the 7th lunar day you rashly uttered words that carry a negative charge, and they will suddenly affect your life in the most unpleasant way. On the 7th lunar day, it is desirable to speak less generally. Say only the necessary and most necessary words, and keep silent whenever possible. The element of the day is Air, and you don't need to shake it in vain. During this period, it is better to refuse to participate in mass events and refrain from attending noisy companies and parties. It is better to spend the 7th lunar day talking to yourself, thinking about your true nature. Some astrological schools also advise not to perform any destructive actions on this day, including not tearing flowers or paper. All the energy that enters a person at this time should be used only for creation, for example, to implement ideas and plans. 7th lunar day - This period is favorable for traveling, both short and long. But only before departure, a good “farewell word” must be said. It is on the 7th lunar day that wishing you a happy journey will be the best talisman. It is not for nothing that all mystical practices paid such close attention to the proper use of words, in particular, to achieving unity of thought, word and action. Therefore, you need to be very careful in choosing words, because each of them has the possibility of implementation. Therefore, you should also limit the number of words you say, exclude from your vocabulary everything that in one way or another carries a negative load, for example, swear words, expressions of malice, hatred, etc. Tibetan astrologers, oddly enough, consider the seventh lunar day to be suitable for funeral ceremonies. Naturally, for poets and writers, the seventh lunar day is the best time for creativity. Inspiration will not leave you now, everything will work out at its best. The 7th lunar day is a very good time to work with both land and water, and especially for pottery. This is a period of absorption and assimilation of Cosmic energy. Prophecies, conveying thoughts, working with words, practicing pranayama. It is also recommended to work with odors, because only in the upper respiratory tract, as well as in the tips of the lungs, the process of transforming cosmic energy, prana, takes place. The day of finding grace and love. Reminds me of forgiveness. In ancient times, people used to wonder by the clouds on this day. When the sky is clear or completely covered with clouds, it means that the world is devoid of harmony. It's good to see the clouds and hear the melodious sound.",

Anyone who can correctly interpret the meaning of the words heard in a dream will discover a lot of useful things, because they reflect the subconscious mind, which on the seventh lunar day expresses itself in a dream through words. It is advisable to write down the words spoken in a dream upon waking up, and on the next seventh lunar day, compare them with what you will hear again. An amazing discovery awaits you. If in a dream you see an image that is symbolic for you, that is, representing the highest authority, the highest wisdom, and so on, then everything that will be uttered is a direct revelation for you. For example, if a believer dreams of Jesus Christ, the Mother of God or John the Theologian during this period, then all that has been said should be taken into account.',

      'In a sense, we can say that the eighth lunar day is a “second chance”: you can try to implement projects and ideas that you have not been able to do before, or for which you did not have time left. But in order for old projects to succeed again, we need to try to implement them not with old methods, but with new ones. The 8th lunar day is a time for new, non-stereotypical decisions. Anyone who remains committed to “yesterday”, who continues to use old methods in their business, is doomed to extinction like a dinosaur. Business and work are a “living”, fluid structure that is constantly changing, and it is impossible to achieve even small success in it if you do not change along with it. Businessmen on the eighth lunar day also need to be careful when assessing their capabilities, since an excess of energy may seem like you can do a lot, but this is far from the case. A sharp surge of energy is temporary, the next lunar day it will pass, and then you will be disappointed. Be careful not to overestimate your capabilities. What you think is a “full reservoir of power” is really just an adrenaline rush caused by a transformational process, and nothing more.',

      'The eighth lunar day corresponds to the element of Fire and not just fire, but transforming fire. Thus, this period is a crucible, through which a person is transformed into a qualitatively new state. It is not for nothing that the mythical Phoenix bird is the symbol of the eighth lunar day - when it burns, it rises from the ashes every time. The same thing happens to humans, both at the mental and cellular levels. The 8th lunar day is the first day of the second lunar phase, which will culminate in a full moon. The image of a butterfly, which appears in almost all mythological systems as a symbol of transformation, also very accurately reflects the nature of this day, because it is the first day of the second lunar phase, which will culminate in the full moon. If we compare both lunar phases, the first seven days are the pupa period, the second days are the butterfly itself. All potential is beginning to take tangible shape. Everything that has been thought out and done so far is returning to a new state. On the 8th lunar day, there may be some emotional instability, unreasonable mood swings may occur, and often a person is thrown from one extreme to another. This condition is due to the fact that personality is being restructuralized - old meta-programs (mental patterns) are being replaced by new ones or transformed into more advanced ones. In general, any such period is always difficult, and the more subtle the transformation, the more turbulent it can take place. Therefore, it is highly recommended to limit yourself from large companies and noisy entertainment events for this time. Of course, you do not need to go to the extreme - if you are invited to a party, you should not refuse, but if you have a choice, it is better to stay at a creative evening in an intimate setting or relaxing in a narrow circle of loyal friends. The main thing is not to find yourself in a place where there is a chance to succumb to any provocation. It is very undesirable to be angry and nervous on the eighth lunar day. You have to stay calm and treat everything with a reasonable dose of irony. Internal openness to everything new and a desire for change will help you easily go through changes. Therefore, everything that comes to you on the eighth lunar day should be taken for granted as a divine lesson that must be learned. It is very important during this period to remain flexible and able not to resist change, otherwise very serious complications may arise both psychologically and physically. Often, astrologers do not recommend doing any work related to fire at this time. It is not recommended to burn fires, except for special ritual activities. You also need to be careful with electrical appliances - a “fiery” day is fraught with burns. In addition, the 8th lunar day is not favorable for working on earth - on this day a person “sows” seeds of enmity, hatred, malice and unrighteousness into the land. You will easily go through all changes if you are internally open to everything new and happy to accept all changes. Take everything that comes to you on the 8th lunar day for granted as a divine sign that you must learn. Stay flexible and do not resist change, otherwise there may be very serious complications, both psychologically and physiologically. On the 8th lunar day, you should think about repentance of sins. Analyze your life, note your bad deeds. Remove all the bad things that have accumulated in your soul and mentally burn them in the fire that is the element of the day. Your past failures and troubles are also burning.',

In addition, dreams open a person to the veil of the subconscious, where there are many forgotten problems, unsolved tasks that you once turned away from, not wanting to do anything about them. You might think it's all over this way, but it's not. Everything that has not been untied will still have to be untied, otherwise you will be doomed to “walking around in circles” forever. Dreams point to these “knots” and how they can be untied. Also, dream images on the eighth lunar day can also be treated as a kind of “barometer” that indicates the state of the ability to change. The more tragic moments in dreams associated with falling into traps, traps, dead ends, confined spaces, falls, the more you are “closed” unable to change. And this leads to the slow death of you as an individual. And, on the contrary, if in your dreams you see vast expanses of steppes, fields, seas, and the sky, the more transformational processes are happening to you.",

If you plan to sign contracts or conclude agreements, if possible, postpone them for at least one day, otherwise things may not turn out as planned. At the very last moment, the deal may fail or there may be some misunderstandings. The ninth lunar day is not the best time for Business, so it's best to take a break, retire for a while and devote it to your inner world. During this period, there is also a high probability of robberies; for this reason, security should be strengthened in all warehouses and valuable jewelry should be especially carefully monitored. In communication and at work, you need to be restrained and tolerant of others' shortcomings. It is better to refrain from any criticism and not make comments to anyone, because people are now very nervous and sensitive. Even an innocent, accidentally thrown word can cause a scandal or a serious conflict, which is very difficult to resolve later. Try not to be aggressive. During this period, even your best intentions can be misunderstood. If someone offers you a “good” deal or says no to sign a contract on the ninth lunar day, you're probably “under the pig”. As mentioned above, this is a period of temptations and “unclean” deeds. Do not take part in any adventurous activities: started on the ninth lunar day, they usually end in serious trouble, including imprisonment. If possible, do not leave your home at this time and do not attend any presentations or entertainment events. Many astrological schools claim that this period is dangerous for attempts on people who own large sums of money. An ideal activity for a Businessman on the ninth lunar day would be his hobby.

      "The ninth lunar day is the first “hard” day in the lunar month. It is fraught with temptations, so be constantly on the lookout. The “shadow” side of the human person comes to the fore. All vices, deeply hidden “black” thoughts and desires rise from the depths of the subconscious and try to realize themselves at any cost. That is why this time is fraught with serious problems with far-reaching negative consequences. Numerous quarrels and conflicts can arise, and completely from scratch. On the 9th lunar day, you need to be careful in everything from crossing the street to using cutlery, as this day increases the likelihood of injury and injury. It is desirable to limit contacts with unfamiliar people as much as possible: any of them can draw you into an adventure. If you understand the nature of the 9th lunar day correctly, you can avoid many misfortunes and tragedies. During this period, karma unfolds: a person's subconscious rhythms are synchronous with the rhythms of lunar energy. The result is a situation in which everything you've previously closed your eyes to comes out. From the depths of your subconscious mind, all unresolved problems, broken promises, hatred, anger, resentment, etc. rise to the surface. You can heal from this condition if you do what you should have done a long time ago. Remember: on the 9th lunar day, nothing happens by chance. Everything you'll face during this period is your past unresolved problems. We have already said that all our thoughts and actions are recorded in the astral plane in the form of matrices. And in the future, if we don't change anything in our lives (primarily spiritually), all these patterns come back to us at regular intervals with a reminder. We're “stuck in the same place because there's no way we can fill in the finished matrix.” We find ourselves in the same situations all the time. And this is despite the fact that we only need to solve the problem once, and not run away from it, thinking that it will “resolve itself”. In short, it is better to show will, perseverance and determination once than to constantly return to the same topic. On the 9th lunar day, you don't need to put anything off “indefinitely”: the subconscious mind becomes this box. A ship, burdened with heavy loads, is sure to sink. The 9th lunar day is the day of karma healing. During this period, a creative person may be inspired, and new thoughts, ideas, and ideas for new creative projects may suddenly come. If that's the case, that's a good sign. So you've untied the karmic knot correctly, and the energy he held back before has finally rushed in the right direction. The same can be said about self-education. If you feel a craving for new knowledge, it means that you are free from some restrictions and the energy you previously held back needs to be implemented. Creativity and self-education are two similar processes, as they are characterized by concentration and openness to new things. In both cases, we need to be flexible and think outside the box. Try not to respond to comments about the quality of your work. Most of the time, they are unfair on the 9th lunar day. Besides, this is not the best day to stand up for your opinion. Think about your dignity. Reinforce the idea that you are no better or worse than others, but at the same time a unique being with your own and certainly positive outlook on life. Try not to commit even a little unethical act. Parents will be the best support and protection from self-doubt. Call them and have a heart-to-heart talk to them. Be sure to remember all the good things you have thanks to your parents and sincerely thank them for it. Creativity and self-education are two similar processes, as they are both characterized by concentration, openness to new things, flexibility and non-stereotyped thinking. To succeed in creative endeavors and in the field of self-education, it is necessary to show heuristic consciousness. The ninth lunar day gives a person the opportunity to use energy that was previously unused in him due to energy blocks as a result of karmic “knots”. For those who easily fall under the influence of others, who are easily led astray, and who are prone to sudden outbursts of anger and aggression, it is better to refrain from such events. The 9th lunar day is a period of spiritual strength.",

Whoever does this will never change their habit. It is very good to start building a family house during this period. The construction will be successful and fast, and life in such a house will be fun and joyful.

Therefore, it is believed that it is also the day of the founder of the family. For this reason, many astrologers now advise going to church and remembering deceased relatives and parents. Family quarrels and conflicts are very dangerous on the tenth lunar day. They should be avoided by all possible means. Be tolerant, do not be afraid to compromise, otherwise the conflict that has arisen between family members during this period will remain in the family for a long time, figuratively speaking, “will take root”.

Of course, it may also happen that a woman, for physiological reasons, cannot conceive a child on this lunar day, in which case it is better to give up sex today, replacing it with an erotic massage, if possible using aromatic oils. This day is also ideal for talking to a teenage child about sexual topics. Don't wait for him to get detailed information on the street, but enter him into the wonderful world of sex yourself. In this case, you will be sure that your child will get acquainted with this issue only from its physiological side, but also from the spiritual side.",

A distinctive feature of couples getting married at this time is the large number of children. But you need to know that if traditions do not arise in the family from the very beginning and the foundation of mutual understanding and love is not laid, such a family will very quickly cease to exist, it will wither like a tree whose roots are constantly undermined by a worm.

    description:
      "In astrology, the 11th lunar day is considered the energy peak of the entire lunar month. The concentration of energy at this time is so high that any action performed is endowed with crushing power. For many people, the 11th day can be very dangerous: if a person does not find the strength and ability to control such a powerful flow, the flow itself will begin to control the person. In this case, no one can guarantee that everything will end without injuries and injuries. The fact is that at this moment, the ancient forces of the Earth and the forces of animal nature merge with lunar energy, and this whole “cocktail” needs to be released. As the song says, “Earth and sky flash suddenly,” they become so energetic that it's like sparks appear between them. And the entire flow of this vigorous energy passes through a person who is a kind of intermediary between heaven and earth. For the strong in spirit, it will become a cleansing fiery bath, and for the weak, it will become a hellish flame. The 11th Lunar Day is a day of energy flow and interaction with the forces of Nature. The impact of the moon on this day is considered to be the most powerful in the lunar cycle. Be careful and attentive. Use the awakening force to create. Complete all the work started on the 11th lunar day. A passive (sedentary) lifestyle is not recommended, as it contradicts the vibrations of the surrounding reality. However, you should not overload yourself with work either. Everything is good in moderation. On the eleventh lunar day, a person usually feels strong, confident, enthusiastic and eager for action. But if, after starting to do something, he doubts his actions even for a moment, an inevitable collapse will follow. To go through the hot tub of these lunar days, you have to be brave, brave, and believe in your victory. You can't slow down even for a second! Everything on this day must be brought to a positive conclusion. You need to believe in your luck and surrender to the elements that are moving. The same should be done during this period. If you are not confident in your abilities, it is better not to undertake serious undertakings. The most important thing now is to concentrate on the spiritual realm as much as possible. Anyone who focuses exclusively on material values will be swept away. It is a good day to start a political career. Figuratively speaking, you will be able to enter political life on the crest of the wave. This is a great time to start construction, but the only desire should be to complete it. If you know in advance that for some reason you will have to “freeze” construction for a while, then it's better not to start: you are unlikely to be able to complete the construction - something will interfere all the time. Remember that any business started during this period is connected to an unlimited reservoir of cosmic energy. If you interrupt it, even for a moment, Cosmos may perceive this stop as a refusal to provide energy assistance and “de-energize” your event. In short, on the 11th lunar day, you can only start things that require full physical and mental strength. And actions should be brought to their logical conclusion, otherwise they will simply lose their meaning. The energy of this day is not just active, it is, in a sense, aggressive. Ancient court astrologers advised kings to start a war during this lunar period. And so in everyday life, on this day, you need to be very careful with knives, forks and other piercing and cutting objects. In general, on the 11th lunar day, it's best to constantly think about how not to do stupid things. It is absolutely not necessary to undertake risky ventures. Keep a close eye on the environment, look around, do not get involved in scandals, disputes, let alone fights. It's hard to stay passive on this day. Direct your energy to creative practical activities. Astrologers recommend spending your awakened energy on love for loved ones. Show better feelings for your family members and help them both in word and deed. Windsurfing can be a good thing on the eleventh lunar day. Sliding on the board on the crest of a wave, you should not lose your balance and doubt, you need to believe in your luck and surrender to the moving elements. The same should be done during this period. Be situational and courageous.",
    dreams:
      'From the dreams of the eleventh lunar day, you can judge how harmoniously you exist in the space around you, both in society and throughout the universe. For example, if you take an active position in a dream, move a lot, change situations yourself, then you are doing well, you have coincided with the rhythms of nature. And if in a dream you make few movements, become a victim of circumstances, you dream that you are being killed, raped and tortured, then your position in life leaves much to be desired. It is necessary to take more initiatives and not go with the waves like a weak-willed chip. Be the builders of your own happiness. However, this option is also possible: in a dream you yourself become a torturer, rapist, murderer or initiator of any destructive activities. This means that you have begun to take on too many unnecessary responsibilities, have stopped paying attention to your spiritual world, are mired in materiality and are trying to succeed in society at any cost.

      "The 12th lunar day is a period of accumulating wisdom, understanding the World and yourself. The moon helps a person rise above everyday life and understand the interconnection of all things in the universe. On this day, you can realize how the destinies of all people are intertwined into a single thread of life. You are given another chance to have a global spiritual experience of transformation, enlightenment and revelation. The 12th lunar day is a day of mercy and compassion, and the inclusion of the cosmic energy of Love. It is designed specifically for people to think about their souls. It is advisable to go to church, visit the temple or your spiritual mentor. If you are an atheist, then go to the forest or to the riverbank - somewhere where you feel spiritually related to the whole universe. On the 12th lunar day, the gates of heaven open before a person, and the gods hear him. It is today that he will be rewarded for his faith. Even if you are not a religious person, today try to make an exception - start and end the day with prayer, sincere prayer, shivering, goosebumps. It doesn't matter which god you pray to, what matters is how. Open your heart to the divine. If you don't know prayers, at least just try to feel and hear your heart beating in unison with the whole universe. No matter how hard life is, thank God for it anyway. Let these words be present in your prayer: “Lord, thank You for all the good you do for me and for everything that seems evil to me. Thank You, Lord, for giving me the ability to thank You.” The 12th lunar day brings good luck only to those who are able to thank the Higher Forces for the grace they have given them. Think of people who are unhappy, miserable, crippled, terminally ill. Thank God for not having as many misfortunes as many fellow citizens living nearby, in the same city, on the same street, maybe in the same house as you. Alas, there are always enough unhappy people around. On the 12th lunar day, you do not need to be hasty and assertive, everything should go naturally, as usual. This is not the best time to go on trips, long and short trips, even pilgrimages to holy places should be abandoned for now. Think about the merits of others, their best human qualities, and thank people for treating themselves well. Remember that a quarrel started on the twelfth lunar day can drag on. And don't feel sorry for yourself - you'll fall into depression. Twelfth lunar day - This is the best time to get married It is also a day of mercy and compassion. Don't hesitate to show love and care. Do good things to your loved ones, give gifts, give alms, especially if they ask for it, restore relations with people. But don't let me knock you around. The flow of love, directed by the moon's vibrations, can provoke a feeling of love. This is a time of solitude, attention to yourself. You need to be alone at least a little bit on this day. You can't be angry, hate, or quarrel, because it will be very difficult to make peace later. You should not feel sorry for someone, cry yourself. Getting out of such conditions will be a big problem. The twelfth day provides wisdom to overcome negative emotions and strengthen spiritually. Other people's problems should be dealt with only when a person really needs help. Don't rush to help just like that. Perhaps fate gave someone a chance to decide everything on their own. You can give advice, but you can't decide or do anything for others. Try to understand that we take from the universe with one hand and give with the other. The universe is kind to us; it often gives us gifts in return, expecting a return — our love for it, which is expressed in love for everything that exists.",
    dreams:
      'It is necessary to interpret the dreams of the twelfth lunar day only from the point of view of spirituality. The images of your dreams during this period show what is most valuable to you. If in a dream during this period you will see more of the material values of this world, you are too carried away with social life at the expense of spiritual life. Conversely, if you dream of dreams only with spiritual images - lotuses, gods, temples - this is also an alarming sign: it means that you are too far away from the sinful land and are just floating in the clouds. True spirituality is to understand that absolutely everything in the world is spiritual — both an icon and an ordinary dishwasher. Everything should have a middle ground. The essence of spiritual growth is the ability to live in this world, but to be “out of this world”, that is, to spiritualize materiality. Salvation can only be achieved in the world, not somewhere high up in the mountains or in a monastery. For those who are fully devoted to spiritual practices, revelations are in their dreams today.',

The 13th lunar day is a period of renewal and transition to a qualitatively new level of perception. The energy used in the previous 12 days is replaced by new energy. In other words, energy recharging takes place. If you have followed the lunar rhythms correctly and accurately since the very beginning of the lunar month, you will receive additional strength to implement your plans and projects.

A portal has been opened through which many subtle vibrations pass, which contributes to the creation of truly divine works. It's time for clarity, speed, perseverance, and skill. The more resolute you are now, the more successful your undertaking will be. The thirteenth lunar day is like a continuation of the 12th lunar day. Everything that has been started should never be abandoned. No matter what happens, keep up the pace! The success of the whole business depends on this.

On this day, it is also recommended to read a lot: all kinds of information are well absorbed, especially that which allows you to better understand yourself and your purpose in this world.

    dreams:
      "The dream images of the thirteenth lunar day, when interpreted correctly, show a person the way in which he can finally get out of problems, as they say, stop making the same mistakes. The dream symbols of this period hold the key to the deep subconscious processes associated with the ability to be open to new things. And if this ability is blocked, if there is any barrier at the subconscious level, the person is doomed to gradual extinction. For example, all esoteric schools claim that a person will live as long as he is interested in something, as long as he wants to acquire and implement new knowledge. If a person decides that he will have enough to study, which is not interesting for him, and this, he thereby instructs his body to curtail all life processes and prepare for death. This is largely due to such an early death of modern man. The older a person gets, the more he needs to learn, the more actively he needs to strive for new discoveries. It is not for nothing that the famous philosopher and astropsychologist Eric Fromm noted that people who constantly remember the past and live only in its realities are degrading. The dreams of the thirteenth lunar day raise images from the depths of the subconscious mind, based on which a person can discover why he stopped developing, why he limited his abilities and worldview to the narrow limits of everyday life, which forced him to abandon the knowledge of the world and reversed life processes, that is, what event launched the body's self-destruction program.",

      'This is a very good time for any couple to get married, especially those whose marital relationships have been prolonged. Marriage during this period will seem to be the final chord of courtship. It is good for older people - already mature men and women - to start a family. A characteristic feature of this day from the point of view of marriage is that it is, figuratively speaking, a day of free flight, that is, the Moon gives the new family a huge amount of energy, as if it takes them high into the sky and lets them go free. And now everything will depend only on the spouses - whether they will be able to continue their “heavenly flight” or return to earth again.',

      'In terms of Business, this is a day of increased activity. Astrologers advise you to finally decide on what you did not dare to do before (of course, you do not mean risky criminal enterprises). But you need to be careful with any actions, because the nature of these lunar days is such that you can either win the jackpot or lose everything you had. Risk should not look like a whim; it should be the natural outcome of thoughtful and carefully analyzed actions. Figuratively speaking, such a powerful energy flow of lunar energy should be used only for peaceful purposes. On the 15th lunar day, be careful, but do not restrain yourself, trust your intuition and professional skills.',

      "The moon is at its apogee, at the peak of its energy intensity. You have to make the last breakthrough: under no circumstances should you slow down your pace and activity. Everything you've been trying to achieve is finally going to work out. As for love, the 15th lunar day can bring short-term bliss, which will then be replaced by prolonged disappointment. This period, on the one hand, is quite favorable, and on the other hand, dangerous, because the influence of the Moon is strongest. All your positive and negative qualities increase several times. And if you don't want the negative aspects of your personality to get the better of you, be careful. This is a great time to change your life once and for all. If you did not have enough strength for something before, then on the 15th lunar day there will be plenty of them. You can do pretty much anything. If you have an important, all-consuming goal, the vector of your aspiration will draw a new path in the astral plane along which your life will flow in the future. Just remember: the goal must be very desirable. This is a prerequisite, as a strong desire will help you activate all your positive aspects, and the Moon, in turn, will fill them with powerful energy. This way you will be able to overcome your inertia and change yourself. You will throw your desire into the future like a lasso, and then you will “catch up” into a new life yourself. There is one more condition. You should spend the whole day as you would like your whole life to go on in the future. How you will live this day will be imprinted in the astral plane by a clear matrix, according to which the third and fourth lunar phases will develop. If the fifteenth lunar day is spent in passivity, indulging in your weaknesses, then inner transformation will not come. You will only “fuse” more with your negative side of your personality: enhanced by the energy of the Moon, it will become your true Self. People who do not use the powerful energy flow of the full moon to transform their negative qualities into positive ones lose touch with their higher “I”, which has a destructive effect on the individual. Eastern astrologers warn gamblers against their hobbies. It is better not to succumb to temptations and leave maps, horse racing and other gambling activities at least for a while: this can end very badly.",

Figuratively speaking, in the dreams of this period, an angel and a devil come to a person: the angel tries to guide you to a righteous path, but the hell seduces you to do sinful things. If your dreams have more bright images, bright colors, and pleasant events, then you should take even more action to enhance your positive qualities. You're on your way to the Light, you can't stop. If the images are gloomy, they contain dark, dull colors, and the events are disturbing, evoking anguish and fear, then the dark side of your personality has prevailed over you. You should go to church or spend the day reading prayers.",

Astrologers recommend doing more meditative exercises during this period, especially hatha yoga. It will be very useful to get a Reiki session or massage, and any - Thai, Ayurvidic, Chinese, and so on. In addition, this is a favorable period for cranio-sacral or tanato therapy.',
    sex: "Sex on the fifteenth lunar day should, if possible, be energetic, assertive, active, but without frills. Any kind of perversions during this period result in serious health problems. On the 15th lunar day, casual sex is also highly undesirable. It's best to spend this night playing love with someone you really love. The only limit is that between midnight and 3 a.m., no sex! This is a very dangerous time, it's better to just sleep through it.",

The fifteenth lunar day is also favorable for those who are not getting married or getting married for the first time, as well as for those “over thirty”. But young couples on the fifteenth lunar day are categorically contraindicated to start a family. For them, such a union usually ends in divorce. Such families cannot withstand the rapid and powerful energy of the Moon. Paradoxically, in order to withstand the power of the Moon, you have to be strong yourself.',

Some argue that during this period you should avoid hustle and bustle; it is better to devote it to establishing comfort in the work team. Other astrologers say that everything works out in terms of Business on this lunar day, especially when it comes to partnerships. It is good for exchanges, contracting, forming alliances and firms.

      "The sixteenth lunar day is a time to rest from intense and active activities in the period from the twelfth to the fifteenth lunar day. Now you should avoid all hustle and bustle, futile movements and all kinds of tension. It's best to rest, even just sleep. Unlike previous lunar days, where passivity was not allowed, on the 16th lunar day, any activity is undesirable. This is when you can truly indulge in laziness with complete impunity. You can lie on the sofa, watch TV, read a book, although, of course, the best option would be a walk in the fresh air in the midst of nature. If possible, take a trip to the lake, river, sea or forest. Try to be surrounded by peace and quiet for this short period. You definitely need to regain your strength. But keep in mind that all of the above applies only to those who really spent the previous lunar day in hard work. For those who spent them on entertainment or doing nothing, the sixteenth lunar day can bring an unpleasant surprise. If they continue to be passive, they will only increase their inertia, become even more entrenched in laziness, and therefore create many problems for themselves, ranging from ailments to troubles in social life. In a few words, we can say that this is only a time of well-deserved rest! For everyone else, it will be a period of excruciating longing and sadness. A person who has wasted the previous lunar days, and, consequently, lunar energies, will feel very uncomfortable on the 16th lunar day, and will be bothered by unconscious fears, anxiety and doubts. This is due to the fact that the energy potential provided by the Moon was not realized, the energies did not find a way out, did not pass through the body, but remained inside the energy envelope, which caused “waterlogging” - the chaotic movement of energy flows within humans. You don't need to strive to accumulate as much energy as possible; the point is to “pump” as much energy as possible through yourself, through your energy system. Energy needs to flow, not stagnate. Only meditative practices can be the only way out of this situation. On this contemplative day, think of the eternal. Dream, make bright plans. In short, indulge in passive rest.",
    dreams:
      "By and large, the dream images of this lunar day do not carry any important information, but if you have an anxious dream, this is a signal - you have not relaxed. You should definitely learn how to relax your muscles and psyche. Inside you are very tense and constantly anxious about the most trivial things. Therefore, it is urgent to do some sedative practices. It may be ideal to perform one of the yoga poses - shavasana. But usually the dreams of this lunar period contain simply chaotic layers of different impressions, so you should not attach special importance to them and begin to interpret them. This is due to the fact that, in a sense, on the sixteenth lunar day, not only the human physical body, but also its subconscious mind is cleansed, that is, “psychological” toxins are removed to the periphery. So do not worry about the events or images you dreamed of, take it calmly. You should not focus on them so much, because, as a rule, on the sixteenth lunar day, a person dreams of strange Dreams, which usually cause bewilderment or even fear, which is why a person begins to convulsively interpret what he sees, turn to various interpreters and dream books. Don't turn into thoughtless fatalists. There is just a cleansing process and nothing more, and if you focus on it, then your concerns will really come true. So sleep well no matter what you're dreaming about.",

It must be remembered that this time is not intended for active, but passive recreation. It is best to spend the sixteenth lunar day not on a kayak trip, but in a quiet contemplation of nature. Of course, this doesn't mean you have to sit back all day and watch TV. No But you shouldn't overexert yourself either. It is necessary to give the body time to rest and accumulate new strength after the previous active lunar days. All types of cleaning practices will be very useful and successful. They will help the body get rid of accumulated toxins and stress, thus making it possible to enter a new lunar phase refreshed and ready for new achievements. Training that requires the participation of a partner, as well as steam yoga or massage, will be successful.",

If you ignore this advice and stick to a strict official tone, then productivity will decrease by several orders of magnitude, and you will not achieve what you want. Everything that goes against the holiday on the seventeenth lunar day is against the natural flow of natural rhythms, that is, it comes into conflict with the entire universe. And this, of course, will not give positive results. So be easy to work, even a little carefree. Now any type of tension is extremely contraindicated.

High spirits and good spirits are a sign of both physical and mental health, so if you feel sad and sad in your heart on the seventeenth lunar day, then it's time to think that something is wrong with you. It is not for nothing that the teachings of Agni Yoga say: “Joy is a special wisdom”, and in the Bible the Apostle Paul says: “Rejoice, my brothers, always rejoice!” The relaxation that began on the sixteenth lunar day continues today, but after cleansing and regaining strength, a person feels happy for everything he did during the previous two lunar phases (of course, only those who really did something feel this). On the 17th lunar day, it is very useful to attend an entertainment event, for example, go to a cinema, an exhibition, a satirist's concert, a disco, and so on. Go in company, organize parties yourself. Have fun and joy. But remember, joy doesn't have to be adventures; giveaways are yes, but not risky events that can end very badly. For those who are in the process of caring for a loved one, it is recommended to arrange a romantic evening during which to confess their feelings. Such actions are usually successful during this period. But it should be noted that the Tibetan astrological school considers the seventeenth lunar day to be very dangerous and questionable. In their opinion, morality and virtue face obstacles today. They recommend holding funeral ceremonies instead of entertainment. The 17th lunar day is a time of holidays, new joyful discoveries and unexpected surprises. Don't be afraid to sound funny or funny, relax, show a healthy dose of self-irony. Don't take everything too seriously, in a sense, “let go” of yourself and the situation. You don't necessarily need to control everything. This day will go by without you. All you have to do is enjoy life. But this does not mean that you should go and get drunk right away; no, a joyful perception of life consists in realizing your integrity, communion with the Universe and understanding the world as a game. “What is our life? A game!”",

      "Dreaming on the seventeenth lunar day is related to sexuality. Once suppressed sexual desires and unfulfilled erotic fantasies emerge from under consciousness. They all need to be implemented. It's no secret that a proper and harmonious sexual life is the basis not only of physical, but even more of mental health. But remember that this is not about satisfying animal passions, not about rough physical sex, but about full sexual intercourse, which includes not only physiology, but also more subtle levels of human consciousness. A skew in either direction turns sex into either a physical cold act or a feeble romantic effort. Sex is both physical and platonic love combined; separately they are only the pale shadow of real sexual intercourse. It is not for nothing that almost all mystical teachings say that the universe was created at the moment of orgasm of certain gods, at the time of the merger of masculinity and femininity. We should treat the dream images of the seventeenth lunar day with all care and attention - they can reveal areas of our nature that we did not even know about and bring out sexual problems that require immediate solutions.",

It is very dangerous to consume too much on the seventeenth lunar day, both in terms of drinking alcohol and overeating. After all, joy is not about getting drunk and filling your stomach with food, so be moderate when possible. During this lunar period, you can take a break in training and wellness programs. Such a vacation will not bring negative consequences; in some cases, on the contrary, it will be useful.',
    sex: "The seventeenth lunar day is a celebration of sex and love. The bigger it is, the better! It's good to have tantric sex. Make love wherever passion strikes you. During this period, sex is very useful in nature, in the forest, in the field (especially in a bread field), on a river, lake, sea, in a cave and at a mountain top, and, of course, sex in a vineyard will be the most useful and romantic. It is highly undesirable to restrain your erotic fantasies on this lunar day, relax and surrender to sex. Your love should be reckless, festive, extravagant (in some ways even extreme), and exotic. Don't hold yourself back! Drown in orgasm! Some astrologers claim that this is the only day in the entire lunar cycle when group sex is allowed. But at the same time, it is necessary to be very careful, especially for women, since such a period of sexual activity for unbalanced individuals with a distorted perception of reality can lead to inappropriate behavior. Therefore, there is a high probability of being raped. Be careful and once again do not walk through dark streets at a late hour, be extremely careful with unfamiliar men. It is better to fulfill all your sexual desires with your loved one, and not with the first person you meet.",

The seventeenth lunar day is the most favorable time for weddings and anniversaries. This period is the “golden mean” for marriages; it is suitable for everyone, without exception, both young and elderly couples. But the seventeenth lunar day is especially suitable for people striving for a turbulent and romantic family life.

      'In Business, the eighteenth lunar day is usually a completely unproductive period; nothing happens for better or worse. Only you are changing, only your attitude towards your company and your financial transactions. On the 18th lunar day, you need to remain calm and collected, paying more attention to nuances and very insignificant things, because they are where either your further prosperity or decline and collapse lie. As the great Goethe said: “A great man is known in the details.” There is no insignificant thing on the eighteenth lunar day; everything is of paramount importance, especially when it comes to signing important documents and concluding contracts. Pay close attention to the seemingly insignificant points of your contracts, read them carefully, because it is likely that any small line in the contract can cause you a lot of trouble later. When communicating with both subordinates and superiors, make sure not to say too much, control your intonations, as people on the eighteenth lunar day tend to exaggerate the meaning of some actions, especially words addressed to them. Otherwise, it will be difficult to prove to the offended person later that you did not even want to offend or insult him. And, of course, do not be touchy yourself, treat everything and everyone with understanding and patience.',

      "It is no coincidence that the mirror is a symbol of the 18th lunar day. Everything that happens to you during this period shows the state of your affairs at the moment. This lunar day itself acts as a mirror that reflects the true nature of your “I”. In a sense, every event in itself is a symbol that characterizes you as an individual. For example, if people envy you on the 18th lunar day, it means that you are actually capable of such feelings too. Do not be indignant about what happened, it's better to carefully understand who and why you yourself are jealous. What happens on the 18th lunar day can be illustrated by the following image: the surrounding reality is, as it were, a mirror image of our inner self, our thoughts and actions. Each of us deserves our own mirror image: one is crooked, the other is even and clean, and the third feels like a mirror fragment has hit the eye, so he sees everything in a distorted way. In short, the mirror shows us what we have worked out on this lunar day. Keep in mind: there are no accidents during this period, everything happens naturally. Let's take another example. If you have been hesitant to strengthen your staggering bookshelf for a long time, then be prepared for the fact that today it will collapse, and this will be a symbol of your laziness and carelessness. If you sincerely and selflessly helped someone, then on the 18th lunar day, goodness will return to you: wait for a pleasant surprise! In short, the “mirror” of the 18th lunar day will show you all your positive and negative sides. And here, as they say, “there's nothing to blame on the mirror if the face is crooked.” I must say that some astrologers do not quite correctly interpret the 18th lunar day. The events of this period are not at all karmic consequences of previous actions, that is, not acts of “retaliation”, but their symbols. They usually do not end tragically and have no far-reaching consequences. A fallen bookshelf will not crush anyone, and it will not shatter to pieces by itself: this will only remind you that it should have been strengthened long ago. The main thing is to understand the events correctly, take a sober look at what is happening and draw appropriate conclusions. Everything happens now not to punish you, but to make you think about your own behavior and character traits. The next step should be to try to correct them in some way. The 18th lunar day should be seen as a lesson designed exclusively for you, and your future life will depend on how accurately and quickly you learn it. In other words, if you hang the bookshelf again somehow, it will soon collapse again, and the consequences will be much more unpleasant. Figuratively speaking, today you will be “hinted”, and if the “wet” is not understood, tomorrow you will be punished in full. Show maximum observation and intelligence on the 18th lunar day! Tibetan astrologers consider the 18th lunar day to be a very dangerous period. They strongly recommend refraining from conducting funeral rites, rituals and funerals. In general, this is quite passive time: active actions are allowed, but not recommended. It is better to react to the circumstances, be spontaneous and flexible. If the situation requires your intervention, do it, but don't take the initiative yourself. Never try to show arrogance and self-centeredness on this day: the consequences may be too unpleasant. You may lose your credibility, your job, the respect of others, or you may get into a fight with someone else. Be tolerant and generous; remember that almost everyone on this day is a little “off”. Be careful not to become the instigator of scandals. Remember: everything that happens to you is your inner world unfolding outward. The reason for the failures lies not in others, but in your misperception of reality. Change your mind and the world around you will change. If you think you're living in hell, realize that hell is in you and your soul. Listen carefully to what people say about you. Analyze the words addressed to you, but don't take them as a guide to action.",

The discrepancy between our real image and the dream image indicates a violation of the harmony of our being, the disconnection between desire and reality, and the fact that we are unable to realize our integrity. And because of this, our duality makes our lives miserable. If we correctly interpret the dream symbols of this lunar period, we can clearly understand what we should work on to achieve harmony. For example, if you are a quiet and calm person in life, and in your dreams you appear as a terrible villain or monster, then in reality you need to be more active, aggressive, afraid of your true nature and are quiet not because this is your character, but because you are afraid of not being in a winning situation, you are afraid of appearing funny, afraid of losing.

Be wary of any news, especially rumors. Check each information carefully, as there is a high probability of either direct fraud or the effect of a damaged phone. On the 19th lunar day, it is necessary to accept new offers with caution. Whatever benefits they promise, it's better to wait a day or two, and only then, after carefully analyzing and checking everything, agree. On the nineteenth lunar day, there is a great danger of falling into a trap, under the influence of others, and starting to serve others' interests to the detriment of your own. It is very easy to become a slave to others' basest instincts on this day; it is highly likely to be involved in an adventure that has a criminal basis. If you easily succumb to someone else's influence, then generally limit contacts with strangers on this day, it's better to devote time to family rather than work. You should also be more careful about people who come into your life out of nowhere on this day - nine out of ten will give you more trouble than benefits. And if at the same time you are offered to do something that you have not done before and instead of a proven business, take a risky deal, you'd better refuse. Remember: abandoning the established system on the nineteenth lunar day will lead to serious destruction in life and, as a rule, to serious trouble with law enforcement agencies. In short, you have the shortest way to jail for money fraud. In Business at this time, it is useful not to expand the sphere of influence, but, on the contrary, to get rid of unnecessary, fruitless areas, leaving only the most important and necessary ones that are really profitable and further development. For example, in a large network of a large enterprise, there is always a small branch that has been idle for a long time. It makes sense to close it and redirect the funds to another, more promising direction. Astrologers warn that a person who brags about money on the nineteenth lunar day condemns himself to bankruptcy or risks being robbed soon. People with lots of money now need to be quieter than water, below grass.",

      "The nineteenth lunar day is a very dangerous time, one of the most conflicting days in the entire lunar month, tension is just in the air, just one careless word or look is enough to immediately cause a terrible scandal or quarrel with serious and tragic consequences. In a sense, we can say that this day is a test of strength that must be endured at all costs, otherwise you will lose everything you have achieved in the previous lunar days. The Moon Goddess needs to prove that you really deserve all the gifts she gave you this month. As you know, it takes a lot of strength to get to the top, but it takes several times more strength to stay there. Today you are required to show everything you can do, how realistic you are to show restraint, patience and mercy to others, and how you react correctly to the difficulties that arise. A person is tested for how ready he is to fight for his life values, whether this is really the need of his soul, or just words, self-deception. The main motto of the nineteenth lunar day is “Pan or Gone!” Having overcome this period with honor, he will become a hero. Remember the words of philosopher F. Nietzsche: “What doesn't kill me makes me stronger!” This is the time of true warriors who are not afraid of difficulties. In short, this lunar day makes the strong even stronger, and the weak even weaker. But the Moon gives even the cowardly a chance - on the 19th lunar day, you can overcome your fear with one volitional effort, just not chicken out once and openly face reality. The choice, as always, is yours... Now you are likely to fall for self-deception, to think you are someone you really are not. For this reason, today more than ever, you need to be honest with yourself, because, as Makarevich sang, “... and it will be easiest to deceive yourself.” 19th lunar day - On the nineteenth lunar day, you must first think carefully before you do anything. This is a period when every action you take is global. How you treat the world is how the world will treat you in the future. In a sense, today your astral tracing paper will be removed from your behavior, which will then spread to your environment. That is, if during this period your main feature is disregard for everyone, if you think only about your selfish needs, then do not be surprised when in a couple of days no one cares about you. You've created this energy template yourself, so don't blame anyone for your troubles. It will be possible to “erase” such a matrix only in the next lunar month, and then at the cost of many efforts, which will be crowned with success only with a happy coincidence. On the nineteenth lunar day, the Higher Power evaluates you, so be a hero. After going through the fire, water and copper pipes of this period, you will enter the next day refreshed, and if you do it right, much wiser and enlightened. It is best to spend the nineteenth lunar day at home, dedicating it to creativity. It's good to do general cleaning in the house now, throw away unnecessary things, clean where you least want to clean, wipe off the dust where you rarely wipe it off. Clean the attic, closet, cellar, sort out the contents of the drawers - in short, clean up wherever possible. This will renew the energy in the house and allow new vibrations to enter the room. It is highly recommended today to forgive those you are angry with. The 19th lunar day is the right time to “love your enemies”. Don't miss this chance! If you have a funeral or funeral scheduled for this day, move it to another day if possible. If this is not possible, be careful, the day is fraught with conflicts, especially at events where you almost never go without alcohol. Paradoxically, the Tibetan astrological school considers the nineteenth lunar day to be a favorable period for all undertakings, travels, acquisitions, teachings, initiations, blessings, interpretations and ceremonies. This is a magical day that makes it possible to distinguish your thoughts from thoughts imposed by outside influence, so the energy of the Moon on the nineteenth day contributes to the process of moral cleansing of the soul and thoughts. During this period, any person needs to carefully look inside themselves, analyze their thoughts and actions, repent of pride, lies and their illusory fantasies. Try to remember negative ideas suggested to you by someone and cut off not only external but also mental contacts with this person. Be also careful with new ideas (it is not known who suggested them), casual acquaintances (it is not known who sent them). You should also not conclude legal contracts, including marriage contracts (you can confuse yourself with impossible obligations). On the 19th lunar day, there are usually a lot of offers and if you don't work on yourself, you can get into an unfavorable situation. Clean your apartment by wrapping it around the corners with a lamp (candle). If the Moon is in the sign of Fire on this day (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), it is better to clean the apartment with incense, i.e. incense smoke, sage, wild rosemary, juniper, etc. In any case, you should clean yourself and the place where you live. Light a fire, sit beside it. You can clean your intestines and rectum on this day. It is better to eat simple foods made from round vegetables - cabbage, turnips, potatoes, beets. It is impossible to show pride, malice, envy on this day. You can't lie. You can't repay debts and borrow, because the symbol of this day is a spider, a net. On this day, a net is thrown at a dirty person, and the process of catching a shower begins. If a person does not cleanse himself, he will react to resonant dirt and may be caught. Dreams on this lunar day can be scary, but this is an illusion - get them out of your head.",
    dreams:
      "The dreams of this lunar period reveal to a person the “darkest”, deepest sides of the subconscious. But don't be afraid of this. If you dream that you are a sex maniac, this does not mean that deep down you are. The main thing when interpreting the dreams of a nineteenth lunar day is not to fall into fatalism and extremes. Such a dream may mean that some part of your sexual nature does not find a way out. For example, if you are a woman, it is possible that during sex you play a passive role, while your nature is active. Try to be more enthusiastic in intimate relationships, surprise your lover with assertiveness and imagination. In general, astrologers advise not to try to interpret the Dreams of this lunar period on your own, as erroneously drawn conclusions will lead you down the wrong path. It is better to contact professional interpreters or psychologists who work at the intersection of traditional psychology and occult sciences.",

You may feel strong at this time, but this is only an appearance.',
    sex: "The recommendations of all astrological schools for this period are no sex! It is desirable to refuse even erotic massage. At most, you can limit yourself to a bath, but by no means herbal. Just a warm bath and that's it. Today it's better to relax, because, according to astrologers, any sex will now become a rape, even if you started it with the most noble feelings and intentions. Women on the nineteenth lunar day should be very careful - this is the period when sexual maniacs intensify their activities.",

According to other beliefs, on the nineteenth lunar day, families are created only by couples in which one of the partners is actually a sucube or incube.

And for solo actions, it is detrimental, as a loner risks quickly running out of energy, undermining Health and, ultimately, reducing productivity. Those who manage to organize teamwork will achieve good results. It is very important to keep the middle ground during this period - not to hurry, not to fuss, not to rush frantically from side to side, but also not to be passive. It is necessary to be guided by the circumstances and be adequate to the situations that arise. The ideal option on this lunar day is to analyze everything that has happened in your Business over the past lunar days, to look at everything “from an eagle's eye view”. This is a good time to start new business, sign contracts, sign contracts, open new branches, hire new employees, and so on. Remember that it is not recommended to terminate any business relationship or contract on the twentieth lunar day; this can lead to undesirable consequences.",

      "A day to overcome doubts. You can't overwork and sacrifice anything. The really necessary things come by themselves, without much effort. Now the Moon is decreasing - during this period, the body's viability decreases, a person becomes less active, gets tired faster, and his reactions slow down, so at this time you should do things that do not require much effort. 20th lunar day. From the full moon to the last quarter, a process is aimed at completion. The maximum has been completed, now all that remains is to use resources to the end and complete things. You can start only those that can be completed before the new moon, the rest should be left until the new cycle. The waning moon seems to give a woman a piece of herself; as she decreases, she shares her mystical power, while people have a surge of strength and energy. But the smaller the moon sickle is made, the less active a person becomes. It's like some kind of fatigue comes from somewhere. Nevertheless, on the 20th lunar day, it is best to start losing weight, as there is still a lot of strength - physical activity will not lead to exhaustion. In addition, on the waning moon, the body is more actively losing fluid and removing toxins. Take care to compensate for losses with mineral-enriched drinks. Limit calories, avoid starchy and sweet foods. Herbal medicine and breathing exercises are indicated. Eat as usual and monitor the quality of your diet. It is advisable to do a daily massage using oils that help remove toxins from the body. Figuratively speaking, the twentieth lunar day is a time of “high flight”, when you have the opportunity to look at the past lunar month from above, understand its internal connections, understand that nothing happens by chance - everything is natural and one thing follows from the other. This period is intended for active, decisive, and breakthrough actions. The eagle symbol means that now you can rise very high and simply “fly” over life's obstacles. But to do this, you need to understand the connection between your problem and the rest of the world around you. It is not for nothing that great spiritual teachers say: “Do not look at things, but at the connections between them, and then the truth will be revealed to you.” The 20th lunar day provides such an opportunity to trace the connections between what is happening. Anyone who manages to take advantage of this opportunity will gain a lot of useful things not only spiritually, but also financially. But a step into the sky always begins with a step into the abyss, a step into the unknown, a step into death. For example, a caterpillar perceives turning into a pupa as death, although in fact this is the next stage in its development, metamorphosis, after which it turns into a butterfly and from “born to crawl” becomes a resident of the sky, gaining the ability to fly. It is not for nothing that in all mystical schools, without exception, initiation is always death, a neophyte dies for this life and is born for another. First of all, you need to overcome your fear and not be afraid to step into the unknown. After all, someone who goes into the unknown never knows whether he will return or not. Fear is the most important and serious opponent of this lunar period, and in order to achieve success, it must be overcome. However, it is important to understand that fear should not be suppressed, otherwise it will simply go to the deeper layers of the subconscious, but will still remain, but change it, turn it from an enemy into a friend. On the 20th lunar day, the moon gives a person a lot of energy, which he should direct primarily to transforming his personality and spiritual growth. Astrologers recommend starting construction on this day, taking on responsible positions, and making important decisions. By nature, this is a very communicative period, and it is better to use it to make new acquaintances, establish friendships, visit friends, and so on. But at the same time, as mentioned above, it is necessary to pay attention not to words, not to the people themselves, but to the connections between them, and then you will discover a secret, deep layer of human communication, more eloquent and sincere than Dreams. The second enemy of the twentieth lunar day is arrogance, high self-esteem, and disregard for others. Anyone who behaves in this way runs the risk of falling from a height, that is, losing everything he has acquired during the previous lunar days. And the fall itself will be very brutal for a person, and its consequences will last for a very long time. Avoid fighting with friends right now. The fact is that there is a chain reaction in relations between people on this day, since everything in the world is interconnected. And if the thread breaks in one place today, we can expect a similar effect in others. It's like knitted things, if you pull just one thread, the whole thing can bloom. Therefore, maintain friendly relations with everyone at all costs. If you manage to establish a new relationship with someone, this relationship will last a very long time and will be very strong.",

For the same reason, it is recommended to engage in collective sports games - football, basketball, volleyball, and so on. Some astrological schools recommend cleansing procedures, especially toning massages, in particular back massages.',
    sex: 'Sexual relations may remain the same. Today it is not necessary to introduce something new, you can limit yourself to just high-quality sex. The main thing is for both partners to feel nice and comfortable. This, of course, does not mean that love relationships should become boring, mundane and fresh, no, they should be as calm as the flow of water. No need to look for something exotic, now a well-tested old love technique is better than a new one.',

This is the best period for couples in which both partners are intensively engaged in spiritual practices to create a family. Such an alliance will give positive results very quickly. The harmonious combination of feminine yin energy and masculine yang will raise the family above the hustle and bustle of the world and will help partners achieve enlightenment as soon as possible.

Therefore, it is useful to gather all employees and direct their efforts to one specific task. This is the best time for brainstorming. If you work in the sports and gambling industry, especially the horse industry, this is the best day for your business. But don't get involved in pointless competitions, don't be fooled by the stupid “weak?!” - all this on the twenty-first lunar day can only lead to disappointment.

      "This is a day of rapid action, creativity and inspiration, perhaps one of the most creative days in the entire lunar month. Therefore, all artists, writers, sculptors, actors, dancers are encouraged to use it in full. This is the best time to hold creative evenings, concerts, exhibitions and similar events related to creativity in one way or another. It is not for nothing that Pegasus is the symbol of the twenty-first lunar day. This means that on 21 lunar days, inspiration will visit everyone, the main thing is not to miss the moment and use it correctly, that is, not to waste it in vain, but to direct it in the right direction, to transform the lunar energies into a creative process. The horse, one of the symbols of the twenty-first lunar day, says that the energy of the Moon is now so powerful that it can help you do something several times faster. That is, with the proper use of the Moon's energy, events can run like a horse. It is not for nothing that in many mythological worldviews, the horse is a carrier between worlds. For example, Sleipner is the horse of the god Odin. Some astrologers consider this period to be favorable for sports competitions, various festivals, competitions, quizzes and games. The powerful energy of the twenty-first lunar day gives strength to the oaths and vows taken during this lunar period, so it is not desirable to break them. The 21st lunar day, like the previous lunar day, is a time of collective communication, now you should not stay alone for long, get closer to people, spend this day with friends or work colleagues. The symbol of the twenty-first lunar day also suggests that this is the best time to start traveling, traveling, business trips, cruises, marathons, and so on. However, the Tibetan astrological school, on the contrary, advises not to travel during this period. It is best to stay at home and do household chores. A time of indomitable progress, upward; a day of courage, fearlessness, voluntary sacrifice, renunciation of property; revolutionary changes, perseverance in achieving goals, and the ability to triumph.",
    dreams:
      'The dreams of this lunar period show how a person realizes himself in creativity. Since human nature itself, his Divine Essence, is nothing more than a creative spark (remember that the Lord God himself is the Creator), it is very important for people to properly update their creative potential. If this does not happen, figuratively speaking, mental impotence occurs, which does not allow a person to fully exist in the universe. The dream images of the twenty-first lunar day, when interpreted correctly, can show a person where he is constipated on the path of creative flow. Remember, all children are artists, they love to draw, sing, dance, compose, and so on. But over time, adults explain to them that they are “not Pushkins”, “not Rubens” and “in general, you need to think about money all the time.” This approach creates an energy block in a child, which later, in adulthood, brings him constant psychological and physical problems, in particular, in sexual life. The fact is that the basis of creative energy is sexuality, and if you block it, sex life becomes gray and uninteresting. In one scientific experiment, people suffering from impotence or sexual impotence were asked to fully devote themselves to the type of creativity they did as children. The results were amazing: many of them improved their mood and libido.',

All overloads will have a beneficial effect on Health. The body is now not only able to withstand heavy loads, but also wants to test itself in extreme conditions. Astrologers highly recommend horse riding or just riding a horse on this day.",
    sex: "On the twenty-first lunar day, sex should be active, energetic, creative, filled with new ideas, new techniques, methods and positions. Boring and bland sexual relations are extremely contraindicated. Today, sex is a creative act when your couple in love can come close to heaven itself in orgasm! Imagine that your bodies are in the hands of a Divine Sculptor who sculpts Love out of you. Surrender to your fantasies, don't hold back. Try to have more unusual and extravagant things in your love games during this period.",

For those who are not involved in creativity, it is also a good time for weddings. But only it should be interesting, with lots of skits, surprises and pranks. If the wedding looks like an ordinary drunkenness, then the family is doomed to boredom and longing, constant attraction to everyday life and the hustle and bustle of life. As the wedding takes place on this lunar day, the fate of the young family will continue to develop. Therefore, let the wedding feast be bright, interesting, well-organized and fun.',

During this period, it is very useful to visit your mentor, a person who is your authority, and listen to his opinion on your pressing problems. You are sure to learn something new, you will see a nuance that was not previously noticed, but hindering your path to success.

On the contrary, any planned negative act is now doomed to failure. This is due to the fact that the deity Ganesha, who controls this period, is the lord of demons (ghans), hence his name Ganapati, which literally means “Lord of the Gans”. In Indian tradition, Ganesha is also considered the patron saint of poets. Therefore, they can count on a flurry of inspiration, as they say, just have time to write down. This day is also a good day for scientists. Today, they will definitely come up with a non-standard solution to their problem. The main thing is to focus all your attention on the task and... “Eureka!” This is a very harmonious time, figuratively speaking, it is the golden mean between the spiritual and material worlds. Today, the best way to combine creativity and honorarium is possible. Astrologers believe that on the twenty-second lunar day it is good to transfer knowledge, learn from mentors, educate yourself, attend lectures and go to libraries. The 22nd lunar day is also very favorable for traveling, pilgrimages, trips out of town and business trips, taking vows and taking oaths. 22nd lunar day - Today you have a chance to learn more than in the entire lunar month. You just need not to relax, not to be lazy, but to firmly go towards your goal. During this lunar period, your intellectual abilities are fully activated and are eager for new knowledge. If you spend it passively, lazy and pointless pastime, for example, watching TV or playing cards, then the energy of the Moon will be turned against you and you will eventually notice that every day your memory is deteriorating and your ability to concentrate decreases. This is due to the fact that you did not train your mental abilities in time, and they, not receiving the proper load during this lunar period, simply began to atrophy, as the body was ordered to curtail the activities of this part of your being. Even if you don't learn anything new every day, today you will definitely make a heroic effort to read at least one scientific book, learn at least one poem, and do something that will improve your intellectual level. This is no time for reflection. But if you are still drawn to think about it, then think about your professional and intellectual development. Maybe we should stay at work and try to do as much as possible: another such fruitful day is not expected in the near future. But if your work is associated with physical and nervous tension, then it's better, on the contrary, to relax. Devote your leisure time to intellectual work, at least solving crossword puzzles. But it's better to read something informative, for example, historical or popular science literature. As already mentioned, the twentieth second lunar day is favorable not only for knowledge, but also for transferring your knowledge to other people. Spend your free time educating children, ask them how they are doing at school, if any subjects have been launched, and if help is needed. On this day, every parent becomes the best tutor for their child.",

      "The 23rd lunar day has a high energy charge. It is filled to the limit with activity and aggression. If you allow yourself to be passive or inert for at least a second on the 23rd lunar day, then the rapid flow of energy will simply crush you. However, you need to clarify the following: only your outer life should be active, and it is better to remain calm inside. It's like racing: the faster the horse jumps, the calmer the rider should remain. 23rd lunar day - The energy flows of this lunar day are extremely unstable. Therefore, there is a high probability of immoral acts, robberies and murders. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to avoid crowded places, for example, not to visit stadiums, discos, etc. The more people gather, the more unpredictable their behavior becomes. It seems that on the 23rd lunar day, people seem to ask for quarrels, conflicts and scandals themselves. The fact is that the aura is exposed to very powerful vibrational effects from lunar energy flows. And since most people's energy structure is not harmonized and do not constantly train, an overload effect occurs, that is, the energy shell cannot cope with the powerful energy zero emitted by the Moon. Figuratively speaking, a person's fuses “burn out” and becomes uncontrollable. Energy simply tears it apart from within, looks for a way out and finds it in various conflict situations. By the way, such things do not happen to those who practice yoga, qigong, reiki, shamanism, as their energy field is regularly trained to receive and transform more and more powerful energy flows. For them, 23 lunar days pass quietly, without various excesses and troubles. All their energy is directed in the right direction. But what about everyone else who does not have a trained energy field? The most correct thing would be to direct the energy of the 23rd lunar day to solve pressing problems, especially those that require a lot of effort. Remember, do you have things you can't get off the ground? The energy of the Moon today, if used correctly, will help you overcome any, even the most hopeless cause. The main thing is not to waste the power provided by the Moon on conflicts and quarrels, but to direct it to the right place. On this day, it's better to talk less and do more. All conversations that are not directly related to any important matters will turn into banal gossip. Such a wiping out of rumors, in turn, will lead to a loss of energy stability. The more you talk, the higher your chance of running into a scandal. Try to behave like the symbol of this day, the crocodile, behaves when hunting. At first glance, it seems slow, even somewhat phlegmatic, but it is extremely collected. As soon as a victim appears, he acts not just quickly, but at lightning speed and very accurately. Follow his example: be focused and focused. Use this lunar period of time exclusively to solve important problems, to do the most necessary things. In short, don't exchange for little things. Tibetan astrologers believe that the 23rd lunar day is one of the most favorable periods for starting construction and getting support from outside. If you lose any things on the 23rd lunar day, try to take this fact with joy, because you only lose what you no longer need, which hinders your development. If you start to panic and get upset in such a case, you may experience more difficult situations. Remember: “A holy place is never empty.” If you've lost something, there's room for something new. In your mind, you need to swim against the current. Everyone is angry - you are smiling, everyone is excited - you are calm, everyone is accusing you of mortal sins - you feel no guilt. This approach to the surrounding reality is essential. On the 23rd lunar day, most of us are at the mercy of our “inner demons” and, unwittingly, do a lot of stupid things. Quiet but troublesome activities are suitable for this day, for example, homework - cleaning, washing, minor repairs. Along with cleaning, it's a good idea to magically clean the house that we mentioned when describing day 14. You shouldn't go shopping - there are too many people there. You may suddenly lose confidence in yourself and the correctness of your actions. This means that you are the victim of an energy vampire. Someone has come to the source of your vitality. In this case, gather all your remaining will to... smile and stay calm. Everything goes by and this day will also end someday.",

      "The twenty-fifth lunar day is good for trading in any area, from selling cars to buying colored pencils for the office. The problems that arise on this lunar day should be solved not so much by reason and by logical thinking, but by trusting intuition. This is especially true for money, since, according to esoteric teachings, it is money that is associated with the element of water. If on the 25th lunar day you fail, for example, a deal fails or your finances are “lost”, do not worry. It's just that your industry is naturally freed from “material toxins”, preparing a place for new arrivals. As a rule, what has left today comes back doubled or even tripled. But only if you take it calmly.",

      "A day of deep knowledge, wisdom and prophecies, and concentration. The awakening of higher mental abilities. It is a good day for traveling and traveling, moving, shopping and legal matters, sleeping and relaxing. Dating is favorable. It will be a joy to meet friends and like-minded people, relatives and members of the opposite sex. The 25th lunar day is a passive, contemplative day, a period of loneliness. The motto of this day can be the words of Georgy Vitsin from his last interview. When asked what he would like to wish the newspaper's readers, he said: “Don't make a fuss, people.” On this lunar day, you should not be hasty, you need to be thorough and slow. It is not for nothing that the symbol of the twenty-fifth lunar day is a turtle. So for this short period, a person should be like a turtle - think about his step several times, weigh the pros and cons, and only then move. The twenty-fifth lunar day is a time of solidity, finding peace, in a sense you need to “lie down and not stick out”. As V. sang Vysotsky: “I would like to lie down like a submarine so they can't sleep.” As a rule, astrologers advise devoting the 25th lunar day to internal problems, understanding yourself, thinking about your character traits, and summing up the results of your inner spiritual life. This is a time of relaxation and, in a sense, reflection. But despite the contemplation of this lunar day, there is also a danger in it - understanding your true self should not turn into self-digging and self-deprecation. You need to be as objective as possible about yourself. After all, your spiritual quest concerns only you and no one else. Today, there is no need to work for the public; everything should be intimate and sincere. Without such periods of inner seclusion, you'll never be able to know for sure whether you're living, moving forward in your development or just constantly running away from yourself. The main goal of the twenty-fifth lunar day is to gain the ability to love yourself, which means not inflating your ego, not narcistical narcissism, but accepting yourself as you are, with all its pros and cons. Tibetan astrologers believe that the twenty-fifth lunar day is favorable for traveling, various kinds of trips, business trips, and so on. It is believed that everyone who goes on the road now will certainly be lucky, but only if the traveler is not in a hurry. The Tibetan School of Astrology also believes that funeral rituals and ceremonies can be held on the 25th lunar day. The twenty-fifth lunar day is the time when, first of all, you need to listen to your intuition and trust your heart. Reason and logical thinking can let you down during such a period. Rely entirely on your inner voice.",

You need to remain calm and restrained, treat everything that happens with some irony, and at all costs not lose your sense of humor. The twenty-sixth lunar day is difficult not so much with its troubles as with its emotional outbursts. People's mood jumps like a frog - just a minute ago someone laughed, and now they're crying before they knew it, and the good-natured person suddenly became a tyrant and savage. This lunar day is fraught with such surprises. The main danger of the twenty-sixth lunar day lies in its ability to drag you into a quagmire, that is, the emotions prevailing now will drag you into themselves like a swamp. It is not for nothing that the swamp is one of the symbols of this lunar day. If the mood is sad and dreary, then by the end of the lunar day, as they say, you will be deeply depressed and no one will be able to get you out of there. Conversely, if you laugh and be happy a lot, you will soon find that your laughter is nothing more than a nervous fit, you laugh not so much because you are funny as you shudder from nervous cramps.

On the twenty-sixth lunar day, it is also important not to take yourself too seriously. Don't fall into fatalism and, as they say, don't make a problem out of the problem. Keep it simple, get by with little, and be content with what you have. It is extremely contraindicated during this period to be jealous or hate. Relax. As already mentioned, this time is like a swamp - the more you strain and fuss, the more it will drag you into the quagmire. It is very undesirable to go on a trip or a business trip today. No matter how well the journey starts, it will still end badly. You'll lose more than you find. The Tibetan School of Astrology believes that this is a good time to take various vows and oaths.

This image shows that everything aimed at spiritual search during this period will end successfully, because the Lord God himself blesses such actions. The twenty-eighth lunar day is a period of spiritual maturation and wisdom. The lunar month is almost fully lived, and every person has changed. Those who followed the lunar rhythms, who moved in unison with the Moon, gain the mercy of the Night Goddess. On the 28th lunar day, you can truly recognize yourself by your fruits. Everything planted on previous lunar days will sprout today. Therefore, the motto of the period is “What I sow, I reaped”. Everything you planted on previous lunar days will sprout today. If unpleasant events happen to you, do not consider them unexpected: this is the expected result of your negative actions throughout the entire lunar month. If you did everything right throughout the lunar month and today the first fruits of your previous actions have appeared, then, first, you need to accept them in joy, but not in idleness. Do not wash the first sprout of success that appears until you lose control, otherwise the victory will end there. Secondly, when the first fruit appears, try not to slow down, do not relax, on the contrary, gather your strength and act, act, act... Thirdly, act, do not put pressure on the situation, keep the same pace, do not try to gain momentum even more. This will only lead to complete collapse, since a particular situation must have a certain pace, a certain vibration of implementation in order to its logical and successful conclusion, and if this pace is broken, there will be a situation of “stumbling”, and the result may not be what was expected (if at all).

Optimally combine creative and contemplative activity, such as slow work on the garden plot. Plant flowers and admire their beauty. On the 28th lunar day, any destructive actions are prohibited. On the same plot, nothing should be torn up, dug up or uprooted. It is better not even to give flowers on this day: in this case, you also become involved in the destruction.

The fact is that his energy is so powerful that most people simply can't handle it. As a rule, the twenty-ninth lunar day ends the lunar cycle. The 30th lunar day in a lunar month does not always happen, and if they do, they last very short. Thus, in fact, the 29th lunar day is the final of the lunar month.

And if you don't realize it in time, acute situations can turn into hostile relations for years to come. On this day, you can take any carelessly thrown word as a blood insult, and you will only be interested in one question: “How to take revenge?” It is not for nothing that the octopus is a symbol of these lunar days: with its tentacles of negative thoughts and negative emotions, it will develop your entire consciousness, so try not to lose control over yourself, otherwise your whole life will be devoted to one goal - to inflict even more offense on your offenders. On the 29th lunar day, you should be especially restrained and attentive. Be tolerant of others' shortcomings, do not react too violently to attacks in your direction.

However, despite the danger of this period, do not focus on its negative aspects. An excessive sense of fear, doubt and doom is in itself a danger. We can avoid many unpleasant situations if we change our attitude towards what is happening. It's just that everything should be taken with humor and irony. Don't take everything personally. Anyone who spends the 29th lunar day with dignity will enter the new lunar cycle renewed and changed. The Moon Goddess will grant such a person her mercy and blessing.
