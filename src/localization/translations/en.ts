      'The 1st lunar day is like a vegetable garden, where you only need to sow the grain. There is no need to water or fertilize it. The grain of the next lunar month must first "get used" to the soil. There is no need to rush anything, everything must go its way and naturally. It is very important during this period to remain calm and benevolent, because any business started on the 1st lunar day will not be solved during the month, but on the contrary, it will drag on, figuratively speaking - "swamped". Everything that you try to start will "stall", it will be as if you will walk in a circle. If a conflict happens today, it will not be resolved during the whole month. No matter what you do, no matter what you try to change, events will still unfold so that situations will arise again, provoking more and more mutual claims, which, naturally, will ignite conflict each time. Everything you will think and do during this period will subconsciously become your life program for the whole next lunar month, and it will be very difficult to change anything in it. Any attempt to start any business "at once" on the 1st Lunar Day will suddenly encounter many obstacles, dead ends, which seem to appear as if out of nowhere, as devils out of a box, on the way of realizing your plans. Short advances will be constantly replaced at best by a long trample on the spot and, as a rule, by a great rollback. Of course, when it comes to life and death, there is, as they say, no third option. But such a force majeure situation does not happen often, and it develops according to completely different laws. It is better to spend the first lunar day, if possible, at home, and if there is no such a possibility, then be as tolerant as possible to others\' opinions, try not to take anything to heart. Keep a sense of humor and a reasonable amount of irony, not turning into sarcasm or cynicism. Remember that any action you take on this lunar day becomes a sort of tuning for the whole lunar month, a sort of statement of what exactly you want. The first lunar day is ideal for petitions. It is believed that a petition submitted during this period is sure to bring the petitioner good luck and a positive outcome. It is believed that an application submitted during this period is sure to receive a positive response: the outcome of the case will be very fortunate for you. This is a time of rosy hopes, daring plans, lofty dreams, and good beginnings. Think only about the good. Actively profess "non-resistance to evil by violence. Control your thoughts, avoid negativity. Recall childhood, recall the brightest episodes of your carefree school and college life. Plan your affairs for the month. The first day of the lunar cycle is favorable for making any plans, except plans for revenge. Make as your motto the proverb: "Don\'t dig a hole for another, or you yourself will get into it. Forgive insults not only friends, but also enemies. Of course, not everyone can do it, because it requires courage and a certain spiritual maturity. However, on the first lunar day, it is easier to forgive people than at other times of the cycle. An active social life is contraindicated. It is especially tiring on the first lunar day: it will take a lot of energy. Try not to receive guests and do not go out, do not socialize with a large number of people. Find the strength and courage to finally stop communicating with annoying, useless and just plain bad people. Try to turn the 1st lunar day into a quiet holiday where you can finally be alone with yourself or close friends. This day is favorable for work on the ground. It\'s good to devote it to gardening or just get out into nature. If there is no such opportunity, then at least walk barefoot on the grass.',
    health:
      "Be careful, now your body is completely unprotected, so there is a high probability of getting any injury or illness.  Adjusting to the new lunar month, the body spends most of its energy on the exact 'adjustment' of internal rhythms to the rhythms of the cosmos, and as a result neither the physical body nor the psyche is ready for any strain. It is best to spend this day in peace and relaxation.In summer, this is an ideal time for a walk in the woods or a rest on the shore of a lake, river or sea.",
    business:
      'On this lunar day, it is necessary to refrain from any active actions related to Business, so it is strongly recommended to postpone all business, cancel meetings with partners, sign agreements and contracts. As in any other sphere of human life, the first Lunar Day is exclusively for planning, and only for planning. It is best to devote this time to developing a Business Plan for the next month, thinking through a general strategy of action, carefully analyzing your real situation and looking for new ways to implement your ideas related to Business. After all, as you know, the fastest way to the goal is not the one who goes all the way, but the one who first chooses the best way and only then follows it. Efficiency does not always depend solely on spontaneity, but to a greater extent on wise and fruitful planning. Not without reason among creative people there is a saying: "Improvisation is only as good as what has been prepared. And business is successful only when it is approached creatively. Of course, you should not buy or sell anything on this day. Any active actions in this period are fraught with instability, and in the worst case - the emergence of emergency situations, which often eventually lead to the collapse.',
    esoterics:
      "In esoteric terms, the first lunar day, according to Tibetan mystical tradition, is the most auspicious time for making offerings to your guru, teacher, saint, as well as for carrying donations to temples and churches. The first lunar day is also favorable for taking vows associated with any spiritual achievements, such as multi-day fasts with abstinence from food or words. It is a good day to plan one's spiritual activities and to prepare a program of yoga classes and other religious-spiritual practices.",
    dreams:
      'Dreams of this lunar period reflect what will happen to you during the whole lunar month, but you need to be careful not to fall into fatalism, because these dream images are in a sense only sketches, sketches of future events - some will happen, some will not, some will happen, but not like that. Dream images on the first lunar day are the potency of possible events, a seed that may or may not grow. All that you will see in your dreams, take as certain "reference points", coordinates, in relation to which the events of this lunar month will develop. How correctly interpreted they will depend on the correctness of the chosen life direction',
    sex: 'On the first lunar day, sex should be avoided if possible. The body, as mentioned above, is in a state of self-correction, so any interference will entail an error in the tuning of your biocomputer. During this period, the hormonal system is being adjusted, and sexual intercourse is known to be a very strong surge of hormones, which prevents the body from smoothly entering the new time period. Sex on the first lunar day can lead to serious sexual ailments, which in turn will intensify the aging process. For, as the eastern wisdom says, a person is healthy as long as his sexual side of life is healthy. Therefore, the first lunar day is "a time to love," not "to make love. The period of the first lunar day is the best time to talk about sex and its details. Tell each other about your erotic fantasies and dreams, about any fears or doubts, if any. This is very useful because it teaches partners to trust each other. If lovers will establish a trusting relationship and they learn to share with each other the most secret of sexual dreams, they unspeakably expand the palette of their love games. Do not be afraid to talk about sex, because the sexual manifestation of human nature is multidimensional and how correct and harmonious is your sexual intercourse, depends on how happy your life in general. Also you should remember that a couple who does not know each other\'s sexual preferences and habits is doomed to a lot of troubles that can destroy any, even the most sincere relationship. Recently more and more psychologists and sexologists recommend to have such conversations from time to time. This allows lovers to relax more, to loosen up, to release mental tension, and most importantly - to free themselves from energy blocks',
    wedding:
      'Since the first lunar day is the time of planning, it is best to refrain from getting married during this period. The most reasonable thing is to weigh up the pros and cons of such an important and responsible event and think about whether your Marriage is a caprice, whether you really love each other. This lunar day gives lovers another chance to figure out how well they fit together in terms of living together. Family life isn\'t all flowers and gentle cooing, but also the rigors of family life. The Moon suggests trying to plan for their future life, to try and imagine an ordinary day in the family, when all the courtship and all the "honey" delights will be behind them. What will the couple\'s day be filled with? What will they be living with? What will they have in common? Detailed planning of future marital life will help to avoid unexpected disappointments, which are known to lead to divorce. And, conversely, the more you plan a life together, the more reliable and stable will be the "ship" of your family in the ocean of everyday life. For those who have already applied to the registry office, the first moon day is ideal for planning the wedding itself, deciding where it will take place, how many guests there will be, how much money you need to set aside and so on and so forth.',

      'This lunar day is designed for you to begin to realize everything you have planned on the first lunar day. At this point, you get everything you need to realize your plans and your dreams. Anything that appears in your life on the second lunar day "must be gratefully received" because fate now sends you everything most important for this lunar month. Everything you receive is sure to come in handy in the near future, even if it doesn\'t seem like it at first. Remember, the most important thing now is to "get in the flow. Then you won\'t need to waste energy, worry unnecessarily, and push yourself. If you get into the flow of natural lunar rhythms, then your plans will be carried out as if by themselves. You will have only from time to time slightly correct this process. The 2nd lunar day is the day of the first step and the whole month will depend on how well you do it. The main thing at the beginning of a conceived thing in the second lunar day - do not change your mind, that is, if you have planned to carry out this or that case, you should not doubt, otherwise you will fail. It\'s very important for this lunar period to retain inner confidence in both your actions and the rightness of your intentions. Doubt will ruin any endeavor. The second lunar day is like jumping into an uncharted abyss. You need to hold your breath, stop the flow of your thoughts, and rush headlong into the abyss. You had time for reflection on the first lunar day, and the second is for active, assertive action. Now you can\'t change your mind, replay and rewrite anything, even if you suddenly think you\'ve made a mistake. Still begin to implement their "wrong" plans, and there will be seen, maybe your doubts are only a minute cowardice. A lot depends on how well you make the first step. Throw away all doubts! If you already have something in mind, do not start rushing from side to side: "Did I do the right thing? Maybe I shouldn\'t have...?" If you torment yourself in this way and torture your soul with doubts, you will never succeed. It is important to keep the inner confidence in the rightness of both intentions and actions. In other words, your hand must be steady and not waver anywhere. The 2nd lunar day is the time for any endeavor, no matter what areas of activity it involves. You can embark on any activities. Influence Social Today is very good to start big educational programs, to start learning new subjects and mastering new branches of science. It is good to take office on this day. Influence mystical Omens For all the auspiciousness of this period, many schools of magic warn against performing funeral rites. It is believed that funerals should not be started on the 2nd lunar day. Remember, this day defines the whole lunar month: with what it begins, so it will end! And sorcerers warn against doing anything important between midnight and 3 a.m. on the second lunar day. At this time, it is better to sleep, and if you have to be awake, then you should take precautions. The fact is that this time interval is characterized by extreme instability of energy flows, so you can expect everything. If there is activity awakening in you, then use it for cognition, learning something. You can start exercising regularly in the morning, if you neglected it before. In contrast to physical activity, emotional activity is contraindicated for the time being. On the 2nd lunar day, avoid conflicts, violent family scenes, and clarification of relationships. Try to show generosity and broad-mindedness. Nutrition The second lunar day is good for fasting and establishing a proper diet. It is good to start an exercise cycle on this day. Emotional influences On this day, you should not indulge in anger, you should avoid conflicts and outbursts of emotion. The day inclines to the manifestation of greed, so it is necessary to develop generosity in every possible way and we should not regret what we get rid of. On this day, you can determine what is good and what is bad for your body. It should mentally recall all the products that you are using. If you feel an aversion to something, it\'s not your food. What you are attracted to is what is good for you. The same applies to people - you can suddenly feel with whom you need to communicate, and with whom you should not',
    health:
      'Now is the most auspicious time to start new wellness programs, to begin a new set of exercises aimed at general wellness and prevention. This is an ideal period to study Oriental systems of wellness and to start a small series of massages. In short, the second lunar day is the time to start living a healthy lifestyle. It is good on the second lunar day to start new workout routines, but the exercises should be chosen so that they represent a kind of "golden mean" between loading and relaxation. Static isometric exercises, which are based on the principle of alternating relaxation and tension, are ideal for this purpose. The main thing in the second lunar day is not to overdo the loads, because if you stretch a muscle or overstrain it, it will take a long time to get back to a normal rhythm, because any exercise, movement made on the second lunar day, the body remembers, "writes" in its cells as a program for the next month.',
    business:
      'The 2nd lunar day is for finding sources of funding - whether it\'s finding sponsors or withdrawing money from accounts. During this period it is good to make deals, sign contracts, agreements, i.e. to perform those actions that will help your business plans to materialize properly in the future. On the way to the implementation of the desired goal, you need to make a confident step forward, but without pressure and unnecessary aggression. After the first step it is necessary to make a short pause. This is the best time to start implementing new company policies, to carry out internal organizational activities that will make the work more effective. The second lunar day is lucky for hiring new employees, because in this case, they have all chances to fit harmoniously into the already established team, and supervisors, as they say, "come to court". A person who is hired on the second lunar day, as a rule, brings a "fresh air" to the team and brings the work to a new level. For those who are professionally engaged in business, this lunar period is extremely useful to give some charitable act, to act as a patron of the arts or a sponsor, such as a creative evening or an art exhibition. The fact is that during the second lunar day, the law is particularly effective: \'The more you give, the more you receive.\'',

    dreams:
      'The dream in this period should be seen as a direct guide to action. Dream images will show the way which should be chosen for realization of this or that karmic task, especially in that case, if you really face any problem, and become just a "key" to the solution of an urgent problem. But be attentive when interpreting, do not mistake the wishful thinking for reality. In working with dreams in the first place is important to be honest with yourself - "do not rewrite" the dream for the better, and take their images as they are. The human subconscious does not lie, but the mind is capable of interpreting everything in the direction of the "ego. If in doubt that you are able to interpret your dreams correctly, it is better to ask an expert, to someone who can help you deal with the images that have appeared to you, who can professionally interpret the subconscious symbols and suggest a line of further behavior. Amateurism in the interpretation of dreams in this lunar period is not allowed. In a sense, we can say that all subsequent lunar month dreams will only be clarifications and comments on the dream that occurred in this period, because its meaning is so important.',
    sex: 'The second lunar day is a celebration of sex, so it should be festive, interesting, original. This is the best time to try out new sexual methods, techniques, love games, positions and so on. This is the best time to introduce to your sex life something new, previously unknown, a new nuance, a new note, in a word - a lot of new things. Do not be afraid to experiment, after all, good sex is creative sex, and the more new it is, the better it is. It is useful on the second lunar day to read ancient treatises - the Kama Sutra, the Ananga Ranga, the Tao of Love, or modern textbooks on sex. The second lunar day is the time to expand your sexual palette.',

      'The second lunar day is perfect for getting married. A family established on this lunar day will be strong, friendly and united, and the couple will never be afraid to make a step towards their partner.

      'On the third lunar day, for the first time in a month, the crescent moon becomes visible in the sky. In esoteric terms, its appearance symbolizes the release of everything that previously matured inside. The moment has come when everything that was planned and started in the previous days of the lunar month finally begins to "grow" - to take shape and unfold in time and space. The 3rd lunar day - Among the main properties of this lunar day can be called assertiveness, power, surge of energy, even some aggressiveness. In terms of energy it is a very powerful day, and therefore dangerous. The energy of the 3rd lunar day is like atomic energy. But we know that nuclear energy can be used for good or for bad. This is the reason why it is very important to direct your aspirations to the creative direction, for example, to creativity. Avoid negative emotions! In this period, try in every possible way to avoid displays of personal aggression, suspicion, cockiness, lack of compromise, and anger. It is even better to avoid hypersensitivity. It\'s very likely that good intentions will bring positive results later on. At this time, you are charged with energy, and therefore any action you take can be explosive. On the third lunar day, don\'t think about wishing someone bad luck: your negative emotional impulse will be definitely transferred. But it will create unpleasantness not only to the one whom you wished evil, but first of all to you. Remember that the feeling of hatred directly affects the work of the liver. Not only will you experience negative emotions, but they will be reinforced and amplified several times by the energy of the Moon. Thus, your own body will receive a very powerful stress, which will certainly affect your Health. And you will have to reap the fruits of this stress throughout the whole lunar month. That is why astrologers strongly recommend that you remain benevolent, tolerant, and peaceful on this lunar day. What will help you control the energy flows? During this period, intensive psychological and physical activity is very useful. On the 3rd lunar day it is advisable to give up your work. You can stay up late solving a problem, which will be good for you. In general, this is a very useful and fruitful period: you can do a lot, and therefore you should also do a lot. You have enough strength now in order to undertake the most difficult task. If you don\'t even manage to solve it, at least, you will be moved from the dead point. The main thing is not to be afraid of difficulties! If a problem seems almost impossible to solve, divide it into small parts. Let it turn into several small "problems" that can be solved one by one. And then you will see that even the initial problem that seemed unsolvable, under the motto of this lunar day: "Forward, forward and only forward!" will be solved: the Moon will help you and support you in any endeavor! Passivity and inactivity during this period is strongly contraindicated. If the power and energy given to you by the Moon is not used for its intended purpose, it will still be looking for some way out, and that way out might turn out to be against you. That\'s why there\'s no laziness allowed on the 3rd lunar day. Act, act, act, and act again! If, for example, you have nothing to do, then think of something to do, at least the simplest: go to the store (even if your fridge is full of products) or just take a walk - this is also useful. The main thing is to occupy yourself with something, otherwise all sorts of unpleasant things can happen. If you don\'t direct the energy flow in the right direction, it will start to control you, and then the results might be the most unforeseen. The third lunar day is very favorable for construction Remember, on the first lunar day you were planning, on the second - you were laying the foundation? Now it\'s time to get active. Bravely unfold in space and time your intentions: the moment of translating dreams into reality has arrived. Tibetans, by the way, believe that this lunar day is ideal to start digging a well. Travel You may go on a trip or a business trip. And the farther you go, the more successful the trip will be, because the energy of the Moon will be able to realize itself to the fullest. During this period, the thought process is especially active. You may come up with an original idea, some unconventional solution, in short, you will have an epiphany. I wonder if the legendary cry of Archimedes, "Eureka", was not made on the 3rd lunar day. If you want to find that one out-of-the-box solution to a problem, it\'s important not to throw things away. Concentrate on one, the most important, task, direct all your mental energy to one goal. The 3rd lunar day is not the right time for doubts, meaningless conversations, fears and mental laziness. All these phenomena dull the energy and create a block that will hinder you throughout the lunar month. If the way for the natural passage of mental energy is blocked, constant headaches can start, which will certainly lead to a slowing down of the thought process. If during the first two days the psychological recommendations were reduced to the cultivation of positive emotions and bright mental impulses, on the 3rd day you should actively fight with negative emotions and dark thoughts. If you do not want to be in the phase, you must be able to do it with your own hands. At the same time, try to actively fill the empty space with positive emotions and a positive attitude in life. The period of dreams and plans is over. It is time to proceed to active actions. On this day, even the most inert and heavy on the rise person should show energy and direct it in the right direction. If you dispose of it unwisely, it will simply "eat" you. Passivity is fraught with major setbacks in life. The objects of aggression hovering in the air are first of all those who do not know how to defend themselves. Even people who are not self-confident today should not be afraid of life. The strength to fight is sure to be found.',

      'Those who work at the computer should often rest and stretch the neck, and those who have to talk a lot for work, for example, teachers or lecturers, it is desirable during this period to be as quiet as possible, and if this is not possible, then drink tea more often and not strain the vocal cords. It is very useful for health on the fourth lunar day to take a walk in the woods or park. It is necessary as much as possible to be near the flowers of the trees, especially it is good to be near an oak or ash tree. This will help you to balance the energy flows in your body and bring it in a more harmonious state.',

      'The third lunar day is very productive for those in Business. This is a very good time to make some \'breakthrough\' activities in your business, to reach new frontiers, in a sense you can even take risks, but very cautiously. In terms of Business, the 3rd lunar day should be filled with active actions, for during this period money comes only to the one who "conquers" it, who does not just dream of material prosperity, but does everything possible to make his dream come true.',

    dreams:
      'Dream images on the third lunar day show how correctly we use energies provided by Cosmos, i.e. how adequately we correspond to our energy potential, to what extent we actualize that potential, which was put in us initially. Dreams during this period tell the person where his "energy" hole is, which constantly gives "flow", and where to increase the energy potential in order to get out of this situation and raise his energy level necessary for the accomplishment of new deeds. Look closely to the dreams on this lunar day, they can very accurately show you how to solve the problem you are facing and remove the obstacles to the lunar energy. All Dreams of the third lunar day should be interpreted only taking into account the movement of energy.',
    sex: 'Sex during this period should be active and original. It is very good to do it somewhere in an unusual environment, for example, in the forest, on the water, in the mountains, in an airplane, in a car, in the steppe and so on. This will give your love affairs a new angle and diversify your erotic feelings. In this period, you should use the most extravagant sexual positions as they promote deeper and more prolonged orgasm of your partners. Sex during this period should be somewhat aggressive, for example, let a woman take the leading role. In short, in sex on the third lunar day there should be more extremity, activity, aggressiveness, brightness, indefatigability, imagination, variety and strangeness.',
    wedding:
      'Marriages on the third lunar day should be concluded only by those who wish their family life to be full of adventures, constant trips, travels, unforeseen surprises (not always positive, though) and so on. That is, the third lunar day is the day of the conjugal union of those who intend to lead an active life, rather than slowly pine away from old age in a nursing home. But for those who dream of a quiet, measured family life, it is better to refrain from weddings during this period. It is also very good to celebrate unusual weddings on this day, for example, on the water or high in the mountains, and so on. In short, the third lunar day is the time of extreme people.',

      "Since the symbol of the day is the Tree of Knowledge, the 4th lunar day is the period of receiving information. It's the day when the truth about your real situation right now can be revealed to you. And do you know who you are going to be confronted with? With yourself, with who you really are. The 4th day is like a mirror, showing you your true face, and you won't be able to hide behind any mask. Whether you're a successful businessman or a pauper, an athlete or a scientist, you'll still face your true self on this day, not your made-up self. This is why the 4th lunar day is considered bad by some and good by others. It all depends on ourselves, on the lifestyle we lead, on our spiritual and mental qualities, and on our relationships with our loved ones. The only question is whether we are afraid to face ourselves or, conversely, whether we find the thought surprisingly interesting and appealing. In order not to be afraid of this meeting with the present self, it is very important to have time in your soul to draw the line between Good and Evil, God and Devil, unambiguously define your place in their confrontation. The 4th lunar day is a day of choice. You can turn the received knowledge to creation or destruction. And what you choose will greatly depend on the direction in which the whole lunar month will \"flow\". If the 3rd lunar day was given for active actions, the 4th is for \"fixing\" them. Continue to move forward, but at the same time carefully analyze whether you have lost your way, whether you have made any mistake. All is not lost: some things can easily be corrected, adjust your actions. And it's better if you do it now than later, by the 30th lunar day, when you find that the whole month didn't go the way you planned. The 4th Lunar Day is a great opportunity to see how the world around you reacts to your actions during the first three lunar days. You will likely be able to see how harmoniously you fit in with the reality around you. The 4th lunar day will give you the opportunity to \"fit in\" to the rhythms of the universe in the best way possible. You can find your groove, figure out everything that previously tormented you and gave you no peace. You will understand, finally, how your chosen path suits you, whether your goal is really worth pursuing. The fact that much of our desires and goals that we dream to realize, in fact, we do not need, but simply imposed by society. In pursuing dreams and desires that are foreign to our true nature, we make it completely meaningless. As we chase after mirages, we don't realize that we simply need to return home to ourselves, to the true realm of our spirit, our divine calling. On the 4th lunar day, as a rule, nothing changes for better or for worse: everything remains as it was. This period is characterized by stability and poise. Gardeners during this period are better off not pruning plants, as you can be very badly hurt. Tibetan astrologers believe that the 4th lunar day is ideal for woodwork, be it artistic woodcarving or carpentry. According to Christian esoteric tradition, man is seduced by the devil on the 4th lunar day: it was on this day that Adam and Eve committed the fall. Christian schools instruct their adherents to observe extreme caution with regard to various temptations and temptations in this lunar period. Therefore, in deciding important matters on this lunar day, it is better to rely not on the first impression, but on your intuition. You will have to think a lot about yourself, your parents, friends and life in general. Try to think about spirituality and the immortality of the soul. If you're used to thinking in specific categories, and you irritated by such abstractions, then think about family and friends, how the relationship with them, what you feel is your communication. The concept of \"business\" is not very suitable for the 4th lunar day. Indulge in idleness and reflection. Pray and meditate. Dedicate the day to communicating with family, friends, and relatives. Have a quiet family dinner by candlelight. But remember that heavy alcoholic libations are not welcomed. If you are so active that you can not sit idly by, then engage in some housework. Don't make hasty decisions, especially in business. The moon warns that we are all subject to the devil's temptations on this day.",

      "The fifth lunar day is one of the most important of the first lunar phase, for it is a day of transformation, of inner change. In a sense, we can say that it is the turning point of the first half of the lunar month, because it is the time when everything that was done during the previous four lunar days transitions into a tangible, tangible form. On this lunar day, you need to be especially attentive to all your actions, thoughts, and deeds. Everything that will be thought on the 5th lunar day will certainly find its real embodiment. The Unicorn was not chosen by chance as the symbol of the day, because it represents loyalty to duty and principles. According to legend, it appears to a man only when he expects any important change, any significant step forward in spiritual development. The 5th lunar day is one of the most important in the first lunar phase. It is a day of transformation, inner change. It can be said that this is a turning point in the first half of the lunar month, because it is the time when everything that was done during the previous 4 lunar days is transformed into a tangible, material form. On this lunar day, you need to be especially attentive to all your actions, thoughts, and deeds. Everything that you think about today, everything that you wish, is sure to find its real embodiment. The fifth day of the lunar month is the time of global changes. Everything that will happen to you during this period, should be regarded as the process of transformation of a chrysalis into a butterfly. Even if it will seem to you that everything is falling apart, don't despair! A chrysalis transforming into a butterfly also seems to die, but in reality there is just a change, a transition to a new, higher quality level of existence. During the period of transformation it is very important to harmonize different energy flows, to balance the opposites. This is the time of synthesis, fusion of diametrically opposite phenomena of human being into a single whole. Everything that will be given to you on the 5th lunar day should be considered as the most necessary material for your spiritual growth. And even if this material seems to you completely irrelevant to the given situation, you should by no means refuse it. If you want to make a cardinal step forward in your development, try to combine in yourself the different paradoxes. Only to a person with narrow consciousness and primitive thinking do things seem disconnected. A person with an expanded consciousness sees everything as a whole, and is able to understand that all things are interconnected. There are no opposites, only complements. Black and white, darkness and light are not opposite but complementary. This is noted in all spiritual teachings without exception. Don't be surprised if on the 5th lunar day you will be then good, then bad, then calm, then fussy. Take the change of these states as natural stages of renewal of your being. Most importantly, don't get hung up on any one feeling. Try with all your strength to keep the golden mean, and then the 5th lunar day will be the very font for you, having plunged into which you will come out cleansed and renewed. The 5th Lunar Day is for you to take everything you have, whether it's material or spiritual (spiritual in particular), to the next level. It's up to you to connect everything into a whole, rather than leave it as disparate things piled up in a pile. This is the best time to be alone with yourself. Try to limit external contacts to a minimum. The fact is that during the period of personality transformation, some unforeseen and to some extent inadequate reactions to what is going on sometimes occur. Controlling these reactions is very difficult, and sometimes impossible. Why provoke people to conflicts and quarrels? It is better to be at home or among trusted friends. The Tibetan astrological school, for example, believes that immorality prevails on this lunar day, all virtuous actions are doomed to failure, and actions - to profanity. Many astrologers also agree that on the 5th lunar day, it is advisable to refrain from energy practices, as well as from working with wood, whether woodcarving or garden work. Anything that seems like a hindrance on the 5th lunar day is actually the next step in your development. So you need to find the strength to recognize this fact and use it for your inner growth. There is nothing unnecessary and superfluous in this period. On the 5th lunar day be pure in your thoughts. Analyze the actions of those around you. Try to discern who is \"your own\" and who is \"alien. Thus you will be able to cut off the extraneous to you extraneous influences. Bring to a logical conclusion your good intentions. On the 5th lunar day, you must not leave good deeds unfinished. Unfinished good deeds can turn into trouble for you. Avoid showing unkindness to people. Creativity and persistence in achieving goals are welcomed. If you consider yourself a man of principle, the Moon will be on your side. On the 5th lunar day you will succeed in defending your ideals and principles of life. Generally speaking, any struggle for a just cause will be fruitful. Truth-tellers are given the green light on this day.",

On the fifth lunar day it is good to work on the tendons and energy channels, and stretching exercises are also very useful. Such a selection of exercises will help the body to go through the period of inner transformation faster and without complications, because on the fifth lunar day changes take place even at the level of cells - the vibrational characteristics of the aura change completely. Moreover, even those who do nothing on this day are subjected to changes, though such changes, naturally, occur with "minus" sign, i.e. there is a global destruction of the organism.

Marriage on the fifth lunar day can also be concluded by those who prefer to travel a lot and who are not attracted to sedentary life in one place, who are attracted to adventure and distant countries',

      'Crane was not accidentally chosen as a symbol of this day: it is believed that the 6th lunar day is associated with both the element of water and the element of air. The events of this period are as calm as the smooth flow of water and as light as air. The sixth lunar day can be considered as an adaptation in a sense after the changes that occurred the day before. It gives a person the opportunity to gradually come to terms with himself renewed, to feel himself in a new "skin". As a rule, there are no unforeseen events, no unexpected situations - neither good nor bad - on the 6th lunar day. Usually, everything happens the way it did before, without much change. 6th Lunar Day - Tibetan astrologers recommend on the 6th lunar day to refrain from both long journeys and short trips. It is believed that this time is meant for rest, and travel can disrupt the calm rhythm of life. Such upheaval can lead to unpredictable negative consequences. The Tibetan Astrological School also does not recommend handing over personal belongings to anyone during this period. It is believed that the person to whom you give your belongings can take away your peace and good luck along with them: they will flow away like "water" or "fly away" like the "air" of the 6th Lunar Day. Take the 6th lunar day as a time of rest, passivity, contemplation. Try to be attentive and do not give in to any provocations. Remain calm and tolerant of everything that happens. The sixth lunar day is indeed very similar to water, in which everything is reflected, but nothing lingers. You yourself will be light, calm, but at the same time as mobile as air. If you manage to maintain an internal balance, you will spend this time with pleasure. Do not indulge in thinking. Do not load your mind with worldly trifles. Let your thoughts float free. And then you will discover the truths that you have not yet been able to get to. And these revelations will not apply to the sphere of higher human activity: do not expect that you suddenly come up with a brilliant idea that will turn the whole world upside down. No, you will get answers to simple, but very important questions, such as: "Does he love you or not?", "Is he lying or not lying?", "Friend or foe?", etc. On the 6th lunar day, go about your daily activities in a normal rhythm, but try to detach yourself from the mundane world. Think about the fact that work is an integral part of being, and therefore, like it or not, you have to work.',

It is not advisable in the sixth lunar day to "put pressure" on the financial events, on the contrary, it is better to slow them down and freeze them. You should understand that the sixth lunar day - it is a calm and clear mountain lake, and if you shake its waters, the consequences will be very sad: because of the water ripples you will not notice what is meant for you personally, as Carlos Castaneda said: "You will miss your cubic centimeter of luck". Remain as calm as possible. The ideal solution on the sixth lunar day would be to rest and reflect on what\'s happening, to try, by analyzing your circumstances, to look ahead to the future.

The most important thing is to interpret the dream images of the sixth lunar day correctly. But do not try to interpret the symbols of your dreams too unambiguously, listen not to reason, but to the feeling that you have after the dream. If in this lunar period before you sleep, ask the Higher Powers any question, then you will certainly get symbolic answers. But remember, the question must be specific and vague, implying an exact answer, and secondly, upon awakening, be sure to write down the dream, for prophetic Dreams are quickly forgotten, and the forgotten things are subconsciously replaced by invented or desired ones, which, naturally, will take you far away from the truth.',
    sex: 'On the sixth lunar day, sexual relations should be calm, reverent and tender. If at least one of the partners is irritated or feels muscular tension, it is better to refuse sex altogether, because it can not heal you, like on the previous lunar day, but on the contrary, only cause internal discomfort. During this period be sure to abstain from extreme positions and sexual techniques that require active participation. The sixth lunar day is the time of "classical" sex with traditional positions. Let there be less sex, but more tenderness, kisses, warm words and caresses.

      'The seventh lunar day passes under the sign of the magic of the word. The power of a word on this day increases manifold, and not only a sacred word - a prayer, a spell - but also an ordinary one, thrown by you in vain. That is why during this period of time you should be especially careful with the words you utter, and never send curses to anyone. In this time, curses become especially effective and will definitely come true. Remember that a word is a vibration, which generates some form in the invisible world. In other words, every word spoken in the astral and mental worlds becomes an absolute reality. It is no coincidence that in all mystical practices such close attention has been paid to the proper use of words, in particular to achieving the unity of thought, word, and action. Any bad phrase thrown in passing can turn into a series of big troubles for you. And your word will return not on the 7th lunar day, but some time later.

In this way, you will be able to use the right words, in particular to achieve the unity of thought, word, and action, not without reason in all mystical practices. Therefore, it is necessary to be very careful in the choice of words, for behind each of them is the possibility of realization. Because of that, it is also necessary to limit the number of pronounced words, exclude from your vocabulary everything that in one way or another bears a negative meaning, such as obscene words, expressions of anger, hatred and the like.

This will give a good rest to your nervous system, help to restore mental strength and give the vocal cords a long-awaited rest.

Remember that "speech problems" always lead to ailments of the body and psyche.',
    business:
      'Because the seventh lunar day is associated with the magic of words, it is best to devote it to conducting negotiations, persuading partners and investors, establishing new personal connections, interviewing, propaganda and advertising campaigns, conferences and similar events, where the basis is a word spoken aloud.

      'The eighth lunar day corresponds to the element of Fire, and not just fire, but transforming fire. Thus, this period is a crucible through which a person is transformed into a qualitatively new state. Not without reason, the symbol of the eighth lunar day is the mythical Phoenix bird: burning down, it is reborn from the ashes every time. The same happens to a man, both on a mental and cellular level. The 8th lunar day is the first day of the second lunar phase, culminating in the full moon. The image of the butterfly, which appears in almost all mythological systems as a symbol of transformation, also very accurately reflects the nature of this day, because it is the first day of the second lunar phase, which will culminate in the full moon. If we compare the two lunar phases, the first seven days are the chrysalis period, the second is the butterfly itself. All potential begins to take tangible form. Everything that has been thought out and done before is transitioning into a new state. On the 8th lunar day, there may be some emotional instability, there may be unwarranted mood swings, often a person is tossed from extreme to extreme. This condition is due to the fact that there is a personality restructuring - old metaprograms (thought patterns) are replaced by new ones or transformed into more perfect ones. In general, any such period is always characterized by complexity, and the more subtle the transformation, the more uneasy it may be. Therefore, it is highly recommended to limit oneself for this time from large companies and noisy entertainment events. Of course, you should not go to extremes - if you are invited to a party, you should not refuse, but if there is a choice, it is better to opt for a creative evening in a chamber setting or a holiday in a small circle of trusted friends. The main thing is not to be in a place where there is a chance to succumb to any provocation. Anger and nervousness are very undesirable on the eighth lunar day. You need to remain calm and treat everything with a reasonable amount of irony. Your inner openness to everything new and the desire for change will help you to easily pass through the changes. So everything that will come to you on the eighth lunar day, you need to take for granted, as a certain divine lesson that must be learned. It is very important during this period to remain flexible and able not to resist the changes, otherwise there could be very serious complications both psychologically and physically. Often astrologers do not recommend at this time to perform any work involving fire. It is not recommended to make bonfires, with the exception of special rituals. You should also be careful with electrical appliances - the "fiery" day is fraught with burns. In addition, the 8th lunar day is unfavorable for work on the ground - on this day one "sows" the seeds of enmity, hatred, malice and unrighteousness into the earth. You will easily pass through all changes if you are inwardly open to everything new and joyfully accept all changes. Everything that will come to you on the 8th lunar day, take for granted, as a certain divine sign, which must necessarily be assimilated. Remain flexible and do not resist the changes, otherwise there could be very serious complications both psychologically and physiologically. On the 8th lunar day you should think about repenting your sins. Analyze your life and note your bad deeds. Extract all the bad things that have accumulated in your soul, and mentally burn in the fire of fire, which serves as the element of the day. Also burn your past failures and troubles.',
    health:

    business:
      'In a sense, we can say that the eighth lunar day - it\'s a "second chance": you can try to implement the projects and ideas that previously failed you or for which there was no time. But for old projects to succeed again, you must try to bring them to life not by the old methods, but by new ones. The 8th lunar day is a time for new, non-stereotypical solutions. Whoever remains an adherent of "yesterday," whoever continues to use the old methods in his business, is doomed to die out like a dinosaur. Business and work is a "living", fluid structure, constantly changing, and it is impossible to achieve even a little success if you do not change with it. Businessmen on the eighth lunar day also need to be cautious about assessing their capabilities, because from an overabundance of energy it may seem that you are capable of much, but this is far from the case. A sudden burst of energy is temporary, it will pass on the next lunar day, and then you\'re in for a disappointment. Be careful not to overestimate your abilities. What appears to you as an "overflowing reservoir of strength" is really just an adrenaline rush caused by a transformational process, and nothing more.',

    dreams:
      'Dreams on the eighth lunar day indicate unused opportunities, things that you once did not realize, but which are still worth realizing. In addition, dreams reveal to person the veil of the subconscious, where are many forgotten problems, unresolved issues, from which you once turned away, not wanting to do anything with them. It may have seemed to you that in this way all is left behind, but it is not. Everything that was not unleashed will still have to be unleashed, otherwise you will be condemned to perpetual "going in circles. Dreams point to these "knots" and how to untie them. Also, the dream images of the eighth lunar day can also be treated as a kind of "barometer" indicating the state of the ability to change. The more the dream contains tragic moments of entrapment, traps, dead ends, confined spaces, and falls, the more you are "closed" and unable to change. And this leads to your slow death as a person. Conversely, if in your dreams you see wide expanses of steppes, fields, seas, sky, the more transformational processes occur to you.',
    sex: 'In intimate relationships on this lunar day, you should be extremely cautious. It is best to spend it on "theory", that is, reading books on sexual techniques. Even if you feel the desire and strength to carry it out, still abstain.',
    wedding:
      'Marriages concluded on the eighth lunar day are successful only if the spouses are constantly looking for something new, are open to change all the time and travel a lot. For everyone else, the family created at this time will be a place of constant conflicts and long periods of financial instability.',

      'The ninth lunar day is the first "hard" day of the lunar month. It is fraught with temptation, so be constantly on your guard. The "shadowy" side of the human personality comes to the forefront. All vices, deeply hidden "black" thoughts and desires rise from the depths of subconsciousness and try to realize themselves at any cost. That is why this time is fraught with serious problems with far-reaching negative consequences. There may be numerous quarrels, conflicts, and completely without a reason. On the 9th day of the moon one should be careful in everything, starting from crossing the street and finishing with the use of cutlery, because this day there is a high probability of injury. It is desirable to limit contacts with unfamiliar people as much as possible: any of them can drag you into some kind of adventure. If you properly understand the nature of the 9th lunar day, you can avoid many misfortunes and tragedies. During this period, karma unfolds: one\'s subconscious rhythms are in sync with the rhythms of lunar energy. As a result, there is a situation in which everything that you used to close your eyes to before comes out. From the depths of your subconsciousness all the unsolved problems, unfulfilled promises, hatred, anger, resentment, etc. are brought to the surface. Heal from this condition can be achieved by doing what should have been done a long time ago. Remember: nothing happens by chance on the 9th lunar day. Everything you encounter during this period is your past unresolved problems. We have already said that all our thoughts and actions are recorded in the astral plane in the form of certain matrixes. And further on, if we do not change anything in our life (first of all on the spiritual plane), all these patterns return to us with a certain periodicity as a certain reminder. We "stomp around in the same place because there\'s no way we can fill in a ready-made matrix." We keep getting into the same situations. And this despite the fact that we only need to solve the problem once, and not run away from it, thinking that it "will resolve itself. In short, it is better to show once the will, persistence and determination than to constantly return to the same topic. On the 9th lunar day, there is no need to put off anything "in a long box": this box is just what your subconscious becomes. A ship burdened with an unsupportable weight is sure to go down. The 9th lunar day is a day of karma healing. During this period, a creative person may be visited by inspiration, new thoughts, ideas, ideas for new creative projects may come unexpectedly. If this happens, it\'s a good sign. It means that you have correctly untied the karmic knot, and the energy that it was holding back before has finally rushed in the right direction. The same can be said about self-education. If you feel a yearning for new knowledge, it means that you have released from some restrictions and the energy restrained before requires realization. Creativity and self-education are two similar processes because they are characterized by concentration and openness to new things. Both require us to be flexible and think outside the box. Try not to react to comments about the quality of your work. Most of the time they are unfair on the 9th lunar day. Also, it\'s not the best day to stand up for your opinion. Think about your dignity. Strengthen the thought that you are not better and not worse than others, but at the same time you are a unique entity with its own, and certainly a positive outlook on life. Try not to commit even the slightest unethical act. The best support and protection from self-doubt will be parents. Call them and talk to them heart to heart. Be sure to remember all the good things that you have thanks to your parents, and sincerely thank them for this.

      'In astrology, the 11th lunar day is considered the energy peak of the entire lunar month. Concentration of energy at this time is so high that any performed action is endowed with crushing power. For many people, the 11th day can become very dangerous: if a person does not find the strength and ability to control such a powerful flow, the flow itself will begin to control the person. In this case, no one can guarantee that everything will end without injury or maiming. The fact is that at this moment the ancient forces of the Earth and the forces of animal nature merge with the lunar energy, and this whole "cocktail" requires an exit. As the song sings: "Earth and sky burst out suddenly" - they become so energetically charged that it is as if sparks arise between them. And the whole flow of this bubbling energy passes through a man who is a kind of mediator between heaven and earth. For the strong in spirit, it will become a cleansing fiery font, and for the weak, it will become the fires of hell. The 11th Lunar Day is a day of energy flow and interaction with the forces of Nature. The influence of the Moon on this day is considered the most powerful in the lunar cycle. Demonstrate caution and attentiveness. Direct the awakening power to creation. Whatever you start on the 11th day of the Moon, bring it to the end. A passive (sedentary) lifestyle is not recommended, as it contradicts the vibrations of the surrounding reality. But you should not overwork either. Everything is good in moderation. As a rule, on the eleventh lunar day, one feels strong, confident, enthusiastic and eager for action. But if, having begun to do anything, he even for a moment doubts his actions, an inevitable collapse will follow. To pass the fiery font of these lunar days, you must be bold, courageous, and believe in your victory. You must not slow down even for a second! Everything on this day must be brought to a positive conclusion. It is necessary to believe in your luck and surrender to the moving elements. The same should be done in this period. If you are not confident in your abilities, it is better not to undertake serious initiatives. The most important thing now is the maximum concentration on the spiritual sphere. Anyone who gives attention solely to material values will be swept away by the current. On this day it is good to begin a political career. Figuratively speaking, you can enter political life on the crest of a wave. This is a great time to start building, but only the desire should be such that you can see it through to the end. If you know in advance that for some reason you will have to "freeze" the construction for some time, then it is better not to start: it is unlikely that you will finish it, because there will always be something that will prevent you from doing so. Remember that any business started in this period, connects to a limitless reservoir of cosmic energy. If you interrupt it, even for a moment, the Cosmos may perceive this stoppage as a refusal of energy assistance and "de-energize" your event. In a word, on the 11th lunar day, you can start only those actions that require full dedication of your physical and moral forces. And your actions should be brought to their logical conclusion, otherwise, they will simply lose their meaning. The energy of this day is not just active, it is, in a sense, aggressive. Ancient astrologers at court advised kings to start a war during this lunar period. And so in ordinary life, on this day, you should be very careful with knives, forks and other spiky-cutting objects. In general, on the 11th lunar day, it is best to be constantly thinking about how not to do anything stupid. It is not at all necessary to undertake risky ventures.

On this day, you can realize how the destinies of all people are woven into a single thread of life. You are given another chance to have a global spiritual experience of transformation, enlightenment and revelation will descend upon you. The 12th lunar day is a day of mercy and compassion, turning on the cosmic energy of Love. It is created especially for people to think about the soul. It is advisable to go to church, visit a temple or your spiritual director. If you are an atheist, go to a forest or a river bank, somewhere where you feel your spiritual kinship with the whole universe. On the 12th lunar day, the gates of heaven are opened to man, and the gods hear him. It is today that he will be rewarded according to his faith. Even if you're not a religious person, then today try to make an exception - start and end the day with a prayer, a prayer sincere, to the shivers, to the shivers down your spine. It doesn't matter what god you will pray to, it's important how. Open your heart to the divine. If you do not know the prayers, then at least just try to feel and hear how your heart beats in unison with the entire universe. No matter how hard life is, still thank God for it. Let your prayer include the following words: \"Lord, I thank You for all the good that You do for me and for all that seems evil to me. Thank You, Lord, for giving me the ability to thank You.\" The 12th lunar day brings good fortune only to those who are able to thank the Higher Powers for the grace they have bestowed. Think about people who are unhappy, poor, crippled, terminally ill. Give thanks to the Almighty that you have not had as much misfortune as many of your fellow citizens, who live nearby, in the same city, in the same street, maybe in the same house with you. Alas, there are always enough unhappy people around. There is no need to be hasty and assertive on the 12th Lunar Day; everything should go naturally, in its own way. This is not the best time to travel and go on short and long business trips, even a pilgrimage to holy places is better to give up for now. Think about the merits of other people, their best human qualities, and thank people for their good attitude. Remember that a quarrel started on the twelfth lunar day could drag on.

Do not hesitate to show love and care. Do good to loved ones, give gifts, give alms, especially if asked for it, repair relationships with people. But don't let them push you around. The flow of love directed by lunar vibrations can provoke feelings of falling in love. This is a time of solitude, of attention to yourself. On this day, you need to be at least a little alone. Do not be angry, hateful or quarrelsome, because it will be very difficult to make up later. You should not feel pity for someone or cry yourself. Getting out of such states will be a big problem. The twelfth day gives you the wisdom to overcome negative emotions and to strengthen spiritually. You should deal with other people's problems only when they really need help. Don't just rush in to help. Perhaps fate has given someone the chance to solve everything himself. You can advise, but you can not decide or do anything for others. Try to realize that we take from the universe with one hand and give with the other. The Universe is benevolent to us, it often gives us gifts, expecting in return a return - our love for it, which is expressed in love for all things.",

    dreams:
      'Interpret dreams of the twelfth lunar day only from the perspective of spirituality. The images of your dreams during this period show what is most precious to you. If in a dream during this period you will see more material values of this world - you are too carried away with the social life to the detriment of the spiritual life. And on the contrary, if you dream only spiritual images - lotuses, gods, temples - it is also an alarming sign: it means that you are too detached from the sinful earth and just soaring in the clouds. True spirituality is to understand that absolutely everything in the world is spiritual, from icons to ordinary dishwashers. There must be a golden mean in everything. The essence of spiritual growth is the ability to live in the world, but to be "not of this world," that is to spiritualize materiality. Salvation can be attained only in the world, not somewhere high in the mountains or in a monastery. For those who are fully dedicated to spiritual practices, there are revelations in dreams today.',

It is recommended to create a family to people of faith whose ideals are mercy, compassion, love, and a deep belief in the divine origin of man, to those for whom the material is in second place, and spirituality always takes first place. Families created on the twelfth lunar day tend to be happy, such unions rarely end in divorce. So if you dream that your family will always have peace and love, this day is for you! Remember, if suddenly in this period there will be a quarrel or a scandal between lovers, then it is a warning sign that one of you is insincere in his feelings. It is necessary to check again your attitude towards each other.',

All that was started, by no means should be abandoned. Whatever happens, do not slow down! The success of the whole affair depends on it. On the 13th lunar day, there is an activation of the hidden reserves of the human psyche. The energy field of a person and the energy field of the astral matrix of the conceived project merge into a single whole and rush towards successful completion.

      'The dream images of the thirteenth lunar day, if interpreted correctly, show a person the path following which he will finally be able to escape from the problems, as they say, to stop stepping on the same rake. The symbols of dreams of this period hold the key to the underlying subconscious processes associated with the ability to be open to new things. And if this ability is blocked, if on the level of subconsciousness there is any obstacle - a man is doomed to gradual extinction. For example, all esoteric schools state that a man will live as long as he is interested in something, as long as he is eager to get and realize new knowledge. If a man decides that he has already had enough of learning, that he is not interested in this and that, he thereby gives his body the ability to suspend all vital processes and prepare himself for death. This is largely responsible for such an early death of modern man. The older a man becomes, the more he needs to learn, the more actively he must strive to meet new discoveries. Not without reason, the famous philosopher and astropsychologist Eric Fromm noted that people who constantly remember the past and live only its realities, degrade. Dreams of the thirteenth lunar day raise from the depths of consciousness images, based on which a person can discover why he had ceased to develop, why he limited his ability and worldview of narrow limits of routine, which made him give up knowing the world and turn back the life processes, that is, what event launched the body of self-destruction program.',

But if you feel tired or malaise, intimacy is out of the question, you will only hurt yourself. The absence of sexual desire on the thirteenth lunar day, or tiredness - a sure sign that you have exhausted all your resources, took too much on yourself and did not calculate the strength. Sexual intimacy is best replaced by a light erotic massage.',

So it is better to review and analyze everything once again, to weigh each step carefully, and, if circumstances require it, to dot your i\'s and cross your t\'s. Therefore, it is highly undesirable to "sleep through" it, to spend it passively, indulging in laziness and boredom. Remember that the energy allocated by the Moon, if it is not used today, will be wasted; it will be impossible to leave it for later or stock up. The motto of this lunar time period is "here and now! Many astrologers consider the 14th day of the moon unfavorable for funeral rites, as well as for sowing.',

So before you do something, think hard, weigh the pros and cons, look around carefully - have you considered everything? And only then say, "Let\'s go!" Regarding the decisions you made earlier, you still have a chance to revisit them, to fix and change something in them, before the process gets out of your control. Do not be lazy to revise the decisions you made once again to be able to use today\'s chance in case of any flaws and miscalculations. Organizational issues are very good during this period. If you have accumulated any administrative problems, now is the time to resolve them. On the fourteenth lunar day, all operations in order of business documentation will also be successful.',

Why don't you finally try to activate it, to move it from a potential, a liability to an asset. Try it!",

But remember, if the attempt will be unsuccessful, then you can give up on your relationship. In short, if today's day doesn't end with a romantic evening, then nothing will happen with the object of your desires. As already mentioned, the fourteenth lunar day is the last chance. This is also a very favorable period for couples to start a new sexual relationship. You can try some new technique or technique or just give yourself to sex, especially since there isn't much of it on the fourteenth lunar day. Try to have sex where you've never done it and in a way you've never done it before.",

Marriage during this period will be like the concluding chord of courtship. It is good to start a family for older people - already mature men and women. A characteristic feature of this day in terms of marriage is that it is, figuratively speaking, a day of free flight, that is, the Moon endows the new family with a huge reserve of energy, as if it lifts it high into the sky and releases it into the air. And now everything will depend only on the spouses - will they be able to continue their "heavenly flight" or will they return to the earth.',

      'The Moon is at its apogee, at the peak of its energy saturation. You have one last push to make: by no means should you slow down and be active. Everything you\'ve been trying to achieve will finally come to fruition. As for love, the 15th lunar day may bring short-term bliss, which will then be replaced by long-term disappointment. This period, on the one hand, is quite auspicious and, on the other hand, dangerous because the influence of the Moon is the strongest. All your positive and negative qualities increase several times. And if you don\'t want to be overpowered by the negative sides of your personality, be careful. This is a great time to change your life once and for all. If you weren\'t strong enough before, you\'ll be strong enough on the 15th Lunar Day. You can accomplish almost anything. If you have an important, all-consuming goal, the vector of your aspirations will draw a new path in the astral plane, along which your life will flow in the future. Just remember: the goal must be very desirable. This is a necessary condition, because a strong desire will help you to activate all your positive sides, and the Moon, in its turn, will fill them with a powerful energy. So you will be able to overcome your inertia and change yourself. You will throw, like a lasso, your desire into the future, and after it, you will "pull yourself up" to a new life. There is one more condition. You must spend the whole day the way you would like your whole life to go in the future. How you will spend this day will be imprinted in astral plan with a definite matrix, according to which the third and fourth lunar phases will develop. If the fifteenth lunar day will pass in passivity, indulging your weaknesses, the inner transformation will not come. You will only "fuse" more with your negative side of personality: amplified by the energy of the Moon, it will become your true self. People who do not use the powerful energy flow of the full moon to transform their negative qualities into positive ones lose touch with their higher self, which acts destructively on the personality. Eastern astrologers warn gamblers against their hobbies. It is better not to give in to temptation and leave at least for a time cards, horse racing and other gambling: this could end very badly.',

Risk should not be like a whim, it should be the natural conclusion of thoughtful and properly analyzed actions. Figuratively speaking, such a powerful flow of lunar energy should be used only for peaceful purposes. On the 15th lunar day, be attentive, but do not hold back, trust your intuition and accrued professional skills.",

If there are more light images, bright colors and pleasant events in your dreams, it means that you should take more actions to strengthen your positive qualities. You are on your way to the Light, you must not stop. If the images are gloomy, with dark, dull colors, and the events are disturbing, bringing melancholy and fear - then the dark side of personality has prevailed over you.

Casual sexual relations are also extremely undesirable on the 15th lunar day. It is better to spend the night in love games with the person that you really love. The only restriction: between midnight and three o'clock in the morning - no sex! This is a very dangerous time; it's better to just sleep through it.",

      'The sixteenth lunar day is the time of rest from strenuous and active actions during the period from the twelfth to the fifteenth lunar day. It is necessary to avoid all kinds of bustle, turmoil, fruitless movements and all kinds of tension. It is best to rest, even just sleep. In contrast to the previous lunar days, where passivity was not allowed, on the 16th lunar day any activity is undesirable. This is when one can truly indulge in laziness with impunity. You can lie on the couch, watch TV or read a book, although, of course, the best option would be a walk in the fresh air in nature. If possible, take a trip to a lake, river, sea or forest. Try to be surrounded by peace and quiet for this short period. You certainly need to recover. But note that all the above only applies to those who actually spent the previous lunar day in a hard work. As for those who spent them on entertainment or doing nothing, the sixteenth lunar day may present an unpleasant surprise. If they continue to be passive, they will only increase their inertia, become even more rooted in laziness, and consequently create a lot of problems for themselves, starting with illnesses and ending with troubles in social life. In a few words we can say that this is a time of well-deserved rest only! For everyone else it will be a period of excruciating longing and sadness. The person who wasted the previous lunar days and therefore the lunar energies on the 16th Lunar Day will feel very uncomfortable with unconscious fears, worries and doubts. This is due to the fact that the energy potential provided by the Moon has not been realized, the energies have not found an outlet, have not passed through the body, but remained inside the energy shell, which caused "swamping" - chaotic movement of energy currents within a person. There is no need to aspire to accumulate as much energy in yourself as possible, the point is to "pump" it through yourself, through your energy system as much as possible. Energy needs to flow, not stagnate. The only way out of this situation is through meditative practices. On this contemplative day, think about the eternal. Dream, make rainbow plans. In short, indulge in passive relaxation.',

We must remember that this time is not intended for active, but for passive rest. The best way to spend the sixteenth lunar day is not in a kayaking trip, but in the quiet contemplation of nature. Of course, this does not mean that you have to sit idly all day and look at the TV. No. But it's not worth overdoing it either. It's necessary to give the body time to rest and gain new strength after the previous active lunar days. Very useful and successful will be all kinds of cleansing practices. They will help the body to free itself from accumulated toxins and stress, thereby giving an opportunity to enter a new lunar phase, refreshed and ready for new achievements. Workouts that require the participation of a partner, as well as paired yoga or massage would be successful.",

Other astrologers say that everything works well on this lunar day in terms of Business, especially those related to partnerships. It is good for exchanges, contracts, alliances and firms. It's difficult to say which school is right, but representatives of both schools agree that on the sixteenth lunar day, you should be calm and balanced in all situations, and under no circumstances yell and show no aggressive emotions, because this can disturb the harmony and lead to undesirable consequences.",

      'In general, the dream images of this lunar day do not have any important information, but if you have an anxious dream, it\'s a signal - you never relaxed. You definitely need to learn how to relax your muscles and psyche. Inside, you are very tense and are constantly in a state of anxiety for the most trivial reasons. Therefore, you need to urgently engage in some kind of sedative practices. The ideal is to do one of the yoga poses - shavasana. But usually the dreams of this lunar period contain just a chaotic accumulation of various impressions, so you should not give them any importance and take them for interpretation. This is due to the fact that, in a sense, on the sixteenth lunar day not only the physical body is cleared, but also his subconscious, that is, on the periphery are derived "psychological" slags. So do not worry about the dream events or images, take it easy. It is not necessary to focus on them so intensely because, as a rule, on the sixteenth lunar day people have strange dreams that usually cause confusion or even fear, due to which a person begins to interpret what he saw, to appeal to various kinds of commentators and sleep books. Do not turn into a mindless fatalist. There is simply a cleansing process and nothing more, and if you dwell on it, then your fears will really come true. So, sleep well, no matter what you dream about.',
    sex: 'On the sixteenth lunar day, it is advisable to refrain completely from sexual intercourse. This is a day of rest in every sense. It is better to give to other people a good relaxing massage with oils. During this period is very undesirable the casual sex, no matter how you are tempted, do not give in to it.

All kinds of despondency and sadness are unacceptable on this lunar day. High spirits and cheerfulness of spirit are the signs of both physical and mental health, so if you feel sadness and melancholy in your heart on the seventeenth lunar day, it means that it\'s time to think - something is wrong with you. It is not without reason that the teaching of Agni Yoga says, "Joy is special wisdom," and in the Bible, the Apostle Paul says, "Rejoice, my brethren, always rejoice!" The relaxation begun on the sixteenth lunar day continues today, but having cleansed and restored strength, one feels joy for all that one has done in the previous two lunar phases (of course, only those who have actually done something feel this). On the 17th lunar day it is very useful to visit some entertainment event, such as going to the cinema, to an exhibition, to a concert of a satirist, a disco and so on. Go with the company, throw yourself a party. Spend your time in a fun and joyful way. But remember, joy is not necessarily adventurous; pranks, yes, but not risky activities that can end quite miserably. For those who are in the process of courting a loved one, it is recommended to arrange a romantic evening, during which to confess their feelings. Such actions during this period are usually successful. But it should be noted that the Tibetan astrological school considers the seventeenth lunar day to be very dangerous and dubious. In their opinion, morality and virtue meet obstacles today. They recommend funeral rites rather than revelry. The 17th lunar day is a time for celebrations, new joyful discoveries, and unexpected surprises. Don\'t be afraid to seem funny or amusing, relax, show a healthy dose of self-irony. Do not take everything too seriously, in a sense, "let go" of yourself and the situation. There is no need to be necessarily in control. Today is a day that will do without you. All you have to do is just enjoy life. But that doesn\'t mean you have to go out and get drunk right away, no, the joyful perception of life lies in an awareness of your wholeness, your oneness with the universe and an understanding of the world as a game.

It is very dangerous on the seventeenth lunar day to consume unnecessary things, both in terms of taking alcohol and overeating. After all, joy is not about getting drunk and stuffing your stomach with food, so if possible, observe moderation in everything.

Although if possible, during this period, it is better not to work at all, but to have fun in the circle of your colleagues. If you decide to give out a bonus or award someone a commendation, do it today, on the 17th lunar day. Whatever you have planned for that time, it should definitely be done in a fun, easy way, so that only the funniest memories remain from the event. If you neglect this advice and stick to a strict official tone, then the performance will decrease by several orders of magnitude, and you will not achieve the desired results. Everything that goes against the seventeenth lunar day - goes against the natural flow of natural rhythms, that is, comes into conflict with the entire universe. And this, of course, will not give positive results. So, show lightness in your work, even a certain carefreeness. Now any kind of tension is extremely contraindicated.

      "Dreams of the seventeenth lunar day have to do with sexuality. You will have repressed sexual desires and unfulfilled erotic fantasies. All of them require realization. It is not a secret to anyone that a correct and harmonious sexual life is the basis not only for physical, but even more so for mental health. But remember that it is not about satisfaction of animal passions, not about brute physical sex, but about full-fledged sexual intercourse, which includes not only physiology, but also more subtle levels of human consciousness. Skewed to one side turns sex into either a physical, cold act or a feeble romantic exertion. Sex is both physical and platonic love taken together, separately they are only a pale shadow of true sexual communion. It is not without reason that practically all mystical teachings say that the universe was created at the moment of orgasm of certain gods, at the moment of merging of the male and female beginnings. It is necessary to treat dream images of the seventeenth lunar day with all care and attention - they can open up those areas of our nature that we don't even know about, and bring out sexual problems that require an immediate solution.",
    sex: "The seventeenth lunar day is a celebration of sex and love. The more of it, the better! It's good to have tantric sex. Make love wherever your passion takes you. Very useful sex during this period in the lap of nature, in the woods, in the field (especially bread), on a river, lake, sea, in a cave and on a mountain peak, and, of course, the most useful healthful and romantic will be sex in a vineyard. It is highly undesirable to restrain your erotic fantasies on this lunar day, relax and surrender to sex. Your love should be reckless, festive, extravagant (in some ways even extreme) and exotic. Don't hold yourself back! Drown in orgasm! Some astrologers claim that this is the only day in the entire lunar cycle when group sex is allowed. But at the same time, you should be very careful, especially for women, because this period of sexual activity in unbalanced individuals with a distorted perception of reality can give inadequate behavior. Therefore, the probability of being raped is high. Be careful and don't walk through the dark streets at a late hour, be very careful with strange men. It is better to fulfill all your sexual desires with the person you love, not with the first person you meet.",

The seventeenth lunar day is the most favorable time for weddings and anniversaries. For the conclusion of Marriages, this period is the "golden mean", it is suitable for all without exception - both young and elderly couples.

      'The mirror is the symbol of the 18th lunar day for a reason. Everything that happens to you during this period indicates the state of your affairs at the moment. This lunar day itself acts as a mirror where the true nature of your "I" is reflected. In a sense, each event itself is a symbol that characterizes you as a person. For instance, if you get jealous on the 18th hour, it means you actually have feelings of that nature, too. Don\'t be angry about what happened, but rather ask yourself who you are envious of and why. What happens on the 18th lunar day can illustrate the following image: the surrounding reality is like a mirror image of our inner self, our thoughts and actions. Each of us deserves his own mirror image: one of us is crooked, another one is flat and clear, another one as if a mirror splinter has got into his eye, so he sees everything in a distorted image. In short, the mirror shows us on this lunar day what we have worked up. Keep in mind: in this period there are no accidents, everything happens in a natural way. Take another example. If you have not dared to strengthen a wobbly bookshelf for a long time, then be prepared that exactly today it will collapse, and it will be a symbol of your laziness and carelessness. If you have helped someone sincerely and unselfishly, then on the 18th lunar day, good will return to you: expect a pleasant surprise! In short, the "mirror" of the 18th Lunar Day will show you all your positive and negative sides. And here, as the saying goes, "don\'t blame the mirror if your face is crooked". In fact, some astrologers don\'t read the 18th Lunar Day quite right. The events of this period are not karmic consequences of the previous deeds, i.e. not the acts of "retribution", but their symbols. They, as a rule, do not end tragically and have no far-reaching consequences. A fallen bookshelf will not crush anyone, and the shelf itself will not shatter: it is only a reminder that it should have been reinforced a long time ago. The main thing is to understand the events correctly, to look soberly at what is happening and draw the appropriate conclusions. Everything happens now not to punish you, but to make you think about your own behavior and character traits. The next step should be an attempt to correct them in some way. The 18th lunar day should be seen as a kind of lesson meant only for you, and how accurately and quickly you assimilate it will determine your future life. In other words, if you\'re hanging up the bookshelf again, then in the near future it will collapse again, and the consequences will be much more unpleasant. Figuratively speaking, today you are being "hinted at" and, if the "wetting" is not understood, tomorrow you will be punished to the fullest extent. Demonstrate maximum observation and intelligence on the 18th lunar day! Tibetan astrologers consider the 18th lunar day to be a very dangerous period. They strongly recommend that you refrain from holding funeral rites, rituals, and memorial services. In general, this is a rather passive time: active actions are allowed, but not recommended. It is better to react according to the circumstances, to be spontaneous and flexible. If the situation requires your intervention, do it, but don\'t take the initiative. By no means try to be presumptuous and egocentric in any way: the consequences could be too unpleasant. You could lose your authority, job, respect of others, or have a fight with someone. Show tolerance and generosity; remember that almost everyone is a little "off" on this day. Be careful not to become the instigator of scandals. Remember: everything that happens to you is an unfolding of your inner world outward. The cause of failure is not in others, but in your wrong perception of reality. Change your consciousness, and the world around you will change. If you think you are living in hell, realize that hell is in your soul. Listen carefully to what is said about you. Analyze the words spoken to you, but do not take them as a guide to action.',

On the 18th Lunar Day, you need to remain calm and collected, paying more attention to the nuances and the very small things, because this is where either your continued prosperity or your decline and collapse lies. As the great Goethe said: "A great man is known in the little things." Nothing is insignificant on the eighteenth lunar day, everything is of the utmost importance, especially when it comes to signing important documents and concluding contracts. Pay close attention to at first sight the most insignificant points of your contracts, read them carefully, because the probability is high that some small line in the contract can cause you a lot of trouble later. In your communication with both your subordinates and superiors, take care not to say too much, control your intonation, because people on the eighteenth lunar day are prone to exaggerate the meaning of certain actions, especially the words addressed to them. Otherwise, later it will be difficult to prove to the offended person that you didn\'t mean to offend or insult him in the first place.

    dreams:
      'Dreams of this lunar day should be seen as a mirror, as a reflection of who we are at the moment. The inconsistency of our real image with the image of the dream speaks of the disruption of the harmony of our being, of the disconnection between desire and reality, of the fact that we are unable to realize our wholeness. And because of this, our duality makes our life miserable. If you correctly interpret the dream symbols of this lunar period, you can understand quite clearly what we need to work on in order to achieve harmony. For example, if in life you are a quiet and calm person, but in dreams you appear as a terrible villain or monster, it means that in reality you need to be more active, aggressive, afraid of your true nature and quiet, not because that is your character, but because of the fear of not being in a winning situation, you are afraid of appearing ridiculous, afraid of losing. You need to activate your second half, and then the "good" and "evil" will merge in your harmonious union. You will adequately react to any event - where necessary to be calm, and where assertiveness.',

One astrological school warns: make sure that during love games your bodies are not reflected in a mirror or any other mirrored surface.

      'Nineteenth lunar day - a very dangerous time, one of the most conflictual days in the whole lunar month, tension is simply in the air, it is enough for a single careless word or look to immediately ignite a terrible scandal or quarrel with grave and tragic consequences. In a sense, you could say that this day is a test of one\'s strength, which must be endured at all costs, or else you will lose all that you have achieved in the previous lunar days. The Goddess of the Moon needs to prove to you that you really deserve all those gifts she gave you this month. As you know, it takes a lot of strength to climb to the top, but it takes several times as much strength to stay on top. From you today you are required to show all that you are capable of, how real you show stamina, patience and mercy to those around you and how correctly you react to difficulties that arise. A man is tested in how willing he is to fight for his values in life, whether this is really a need of his soul, or just words, a self-deception. The basic motto of the nineteenth lunar day is "pan or perish!" He who overcomes this period with honor will become a hero. Remember the words of the philosopher F. Nietzsche: "What does not kill me makes me stronger!" This is a time of true warriors who are not afraid of hardship. In a word, this lunar day makes the strong even stronger and the weak even weaker. But even the fainthearted have a chance - on the 19th day you can overcome your fear with one volitional effort, all you need to do is once don\'t chicken out and look reality in the eye openly. The choice, as always, is yours... There is a high probability of falling into the trap of self-deception, of imagining yourself to be something you are not in reality. For this reason, today as never before, you need to be honest with yourself, for, as sang Makarevich "...and yourself will be the easiest to fool. Nineteenth Lunar Day - On the nineteenth lunar day, you must first think carefully before you do anything. This is a period when every action you take has global significance. How you relate to the world is how the world will relate to you in the future. In a sense, an astral tracing of your behavior will be taken today, and then it will spread to your surroundings. That is, if during this period your main feature is not giving a damn about everybody, if you think only about your selfish needs, then don\'t be surprised when in a couple of days nobody will give a damn about you. You\'ve created this energy pattern yourself, so don\'t blame anyone else for your troubles. It will be possible to "wipe out" such a matrix only in the next lunar month and that at the cost of many efforts, which only with a happy concurrence of circumstances will be crowned with success. In the nineteenth lunar day you will be evaluated by the Higher Power, so be a hero. After passing through fire, water and copper pipes of this period, you will enter the next day refreshed, and if you will do everything correctly, then much wiser and more enlightened. The nineteenth lunar day is best spent at home, devoting it to creativity. It\'s good to make a general cleaning in the house now, to throw out unnecessary things, to clean where you least want to clean, to wipe off the dust where you rarely wipe it. Clean the attic, the closet, the cellar, go through the contents of the drawers - in a word, put things in order wherever possible. This will renew the energy in the home and allow new vibrations to permeate the room. It is highly recommended that you forgive those you are angry with today. The 19th lunar day is a good time to "love your enemies." Don\'t miss this chance! If you have a funeral or wake scheduled for that day, move it to another day if possible. If this is not possible, be careful, because it is fraught with conflict, especially at events that are almost never without alcohol. Paradoxically, the Tibetan school of astrology considers the nineteenth lunar day to be a favorable period for all ventures, travel, acquisitions, teachings, dedications, blessings, interpretations and ceremonies. This is a magical day that gives you the opportunity to distinguish your thoughts from thoughts imposed by extraneous influence, so the energy of the moon on the nineteenth day promotes the process of moral cleansing of the soul and thoughts. During this period, any person should look carefully inside himself, analyze his thoughts and actions, repent of pride, lies and his illusory fantasies. Try to remember the negative ideas suggested to you by someone and interrupt not only external, but also mental contacts with this person. Also, be careful with new ideas (you do not know who prompted them), casual acquaintances (you do not know who sent them). You should also avoid entering into legal contracts, including marriage contracts (you could entangle yourself with impossible obligations). On the 19th lunar day, there are usually a lot of offers coming in and if you don\'t work on yourself, you could end up in an unfortunate situation. Clean your apartment by circling its corners with a lamp (candle). If the Moon is in the sign of Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) on this day, it is better to clean your apartment with incense, i.e. smoke of incense, sage, rosemary, juniper, etc. In any case, you must cleanse yourself and the place where you live. Make a fire and sit around it. You can clean your intestines and rectum on this day. It is better to eat a simple meal of round vegetables - cabbage, turnips, potatoes, beet. On this day, you can not show pride, anger, envy. You must not lie. One must not give debts and borrow money, as the symbol of this day is a spider, a net. On this day a net is thrown over the dirty person, and there is a process of catching souls. If a person does not cleanse himself, he will react to the resonant filth and may be caught. Dreaming on this lunar day can be frightening, but it\'s an illusion - get it out of your head.',

    business:
      "For businessmen this is a difficult period, there are various setbacks, unforeseen complications, unpleasant surprises, or nothing at all, at a time when you need something to move from the dead point.

      'Dreams of this lunar period reveal to a person the "darkest", deepest sides of the subconscious. But fear not. If you dream that you are a sexual maniac, it does not mean that deep inside you are the same. The main thing in the interpretation of dreams of the nineteenth lunar day - do not fall into fatalism and extremes. Such a dream can mean that some part of your sexual nature is not finding its way out. For example, if you are a woman, it is possible that during sex you play a passive role, while your nature is characterized by activity. Try to show more enthusiasm in intimate relationships, surprise your lover with assertiveness and imagination. In general, astrologers recommend not to try to interpret the Dreams of this lunar period by yourself because erroneous conclusions will send you down the wrong path. It is better to turn to professional interpreters or psychologists working at the intersection of traditional psychology and the occult sciences.',

      'A day of overcoming doubts. No overworking or sacrificing anything. Really necessary things come by themselves, without much effort. Now the Moon is waning - during this period the vitality of the body decreases, the person becomes less active, gets tired faster and his reactions are slower, so at this time should be engaged in well-established, not requiring special efforts. 20th lunar day. During the period from the full moon to the last quarter, any process is aimed at completion. The maximum is passed, now all that remains is to use the resources to the end and to complete things. Only those that can be completed before the new moon can be started, the beginning of the rest should be left until the new cycle. The waning Moon is like giving a part of itself to a woman; as it wanes, it shares its mystical power, and people have a burst of strength and energy at this time. But the less the Moon\'s serpent is made, the less active a person becomes. It is as if some fatigue comes from somewhere. But nevertheless, on the 20th lunar day it is better to start losing weight, because there is still a lot of energy - physical activity will not lead to exhaustion. In addition, on the waning moon the body is more active in losing fluid, toxins are eliminated. Take care to compensate the losses with mineral-enriched drinks. Limit the calories, refuse from sweets and flour. Phytotherapy and breathing exercises are indicated. Eat as usual and watch the quality of your diet. It is advisable to have a daily massage with oils, which will assist in the detoxification of the body. Figuratively speaking, the twentieth lunar day - the time of "high flight" when you have an opportunity to look at the lived lunar month from the altitude, to realize its inner connections and understand that nothing accidental happens - everything is logical and flows from one another. This period is designed for active, decisive, penetrating actions. The symbol of an eagle means that now you can rise very high and simply "fly" over the obstacles of life. But to do that, you need to realize the connection between your problem and the world around you. No wonder the great spiritual teachers say: "Look not at the things, but at the connections between them, and then the truth will be revealed to you. The 20th lunar day provides this opportunity to trace the connections between the events taking place. Whoever manages to take advantage of this chance will gain much, not only spiritually, but also materially. But the step into heaven always begins with a step into the abyss, a step into the unknown, a step into death. Thus, for example, the caterpillar perceives transformation into a chrysalis as death, although in fact it is the next stage of its development, a metamorphosis, after which it turns into a butterfly and from "born to crawl" becomes a resident of the sky, acquiring the ability to fly. It is not without reason that in all mystical schools initiation is always death, the neophyte dies for this life and is born for another. First of all, one must overcome one\'s fear and not be afraid to step into the unknown. For he who goes into the unknown never knows whether he will return or not. Fear is the most important and serious opponent of this lunar period, and it is necessary to overcome it in order to achieve success. However, it is important to understand that fear must not be suppressed, otherwise it will simply go to deeper layers of subconsciousness, but still remain, but to change it, to turn it from an enemy into a friend. The moon on the 20th lunar day gives a person a lot of energy, which he should direct primarily to the transformation of his personality, to spiritual growth. Astrologers recommend this day to begin construction, to take up positions of responsibility, to make important decisions. By its nature, this is a very communicative period, and it is better to use it to acquire new acquaintances, establish friendships, visit friends and so on. But in doing so, as mentioned above, it is necessary to pay attention not to the words, not to the people themselves, but to the connections between them, and then a secret, deep layer of human communication, more eloquent and sincere than Dreams, will open before you. The second enemy of the twentieth lunar day is arrogance, exaggerated self-esteem, and a spitting attitude to others. One who behaves in this way risks falling from the heights, that is, losing all that he has gained during the previous lunar days. And the fall itself will be very hard on that person, and the consequences will last a very long time. Avoid quarrels with friends now. The fact is that in relationships between people on this day there is a chain reaction, because everything in the world is interconnected. And if today the thread is broken in one place, then you can expect a similar effect in others. It is like with knitted things, if you pull just one thread, it can unravel the whole thing. So at all costs keep friendships with everyone. If you are able to establish a new relationship with someone, then such a relationship will last a very long time and will be very strong.',

It is very important in this period to observe the golden mean - do not rush, do not fuss, do not rush convulsively from side to side, but also do not be passive. It is necessary to be guided by the circumstances and be adequate to the situations that arise. The ideal thing to do on this lunar day is to analyze everything that happened in your Business during the last lunar days, to look at everything "from an eagle\'s eye view".

A harmonious combination of feminine yin and masculine yang energy, will elevate the family above the mundane vanity and will contribute to the rapid achievement of enlightenment of the partners. People with a strong social life orientation are not recommended to marry, because then there will be no mutual understanding in the family.',

Therefore, all artists, writers, sculptors, actors, and dancers are recommended to use it to its fullest extent. This is the most successful time for creative evenings, concerts, exhibitions, and similar events that are somehow related to creativity. Pegasus is the symbol of the twenty-first lunar day for a reason. This suggests that on the 21st lunar day, inspiration will visit everyone, the main thing is not to miss the moment and use it correctly, that is, not to squander it in vain, but to direct it in the right direction, to transform the lunar energy into a creative process. The horse, one of the symbols of the twenty-first lunar day, says that now the Moon's energy is so powerful that it can help get things done several times faster. That is, with the right use of the energy of the Moon, events can gallop along like a horse. Not without reason, in many mythological worldviews, the horse is the carrier between worlds. For example, Sleipner is the horse of the god Odin. Some astrologers consider this period favorable for sports competitions, various festivals, contests, quizzes and games. The powerful energy of the twenty-first lunar day gives power to the vows and vows made during this lunar period, so breaking them is not desirable. The 21st Lunar Day - like the previous lunar day - is the time of collective communication, now do not be alone for long, be closer to people, spend this day with friends or colleagues at work. The symbol of the twenty-first lunar day also says that this is the most favorable time to start traveling, travel, business trips, cruises, marathons, and so on. However, the Tibetan astrological school, on the contrary, advises not to make any travels during this period. It is best to stay at home and do household chores. A time of indomitable movement forward, upward; a day of courage, fearlessness, voluntary sacrifice, renunciation of property; revolutionary restructuring, persistence in achieving the goal, the ability to achieve a triumph.",

Astrologers highly recommend on this day to engage in equestrian sports or just to ride a horse.',
    business:
      'For Business, this is a period of active, impetuous action, which, if you "stay in the saddle", will definitely bring positive results. The main thing is not to "let go of the reins" and trust your "horse", i.e. the energy of the Moon. Actions that involve as many people as possible will be very effective. Therefore, it is useful to gather all the employees and direct their efforts to one specific task. This is the most effective time to brainstorm. If you work in an industry related to sports, gambling Business, especially related to horses, this is the best day for your business.

    dreams:
      'Dreams of this lunar period show to what extent a person realizes himself in creativity. Since the very nature of man, his Divine Essence, is nothing but a creative spark (remember that the Lord God himself is the Creator), it is very important that man properly actualizes his creative potential. If this does not happen, there is, figuratively speaking, mental impotence, which does not allow a person to fully exist in the universe. Dream images of the twenty-first lunar day, if interpreted correctly, can show a person where he or she has a blockage in the way of the creative flow. Remember, all children are creators; they love to draw, sing, dance, compose, and so on. But over time, adults explain to them that they are "not Pushkins," "not Rubens," and "in general you have to think about money all the time." Such an approach creates an energy block in a child, which later, in adulthood, brings him constant psychological and physical problems, particularly in his sex life. The fact is that the basis of creative energy is sexuality, and if it is blocked, sexual life becomes gray, uninteresting. In one of the scientific experiments, people suffering from impotence or sexual impotence were offered to give themselves up to the type of creativity which they were used to in their childhood. The results were stunning, with many of them improving their mood and getting a libido.',
    sex: "On the twenty-first lunar day, sex should be active, energetic, creative, filled with new ideas, new techniques, methods and positions. Boring and boring sex is extremely contraindicated. Today sex is a creative act, when your love couple can approach heaven itself in orgasm! Imagine that your bodies are in the hands of a Divine Sculptor who is sculpting Love out of you. Give yourself over to your fantasies, don't hold yourself back. Try to be more unusual and extravagant in your love games during this period.",

For those who are not associated with creativity - also a good time for weddings. But only it should be interesting, with many scenes, surprises and pranks. If the wedding will look like an ordinary binge, then the family is doomed to boredom and languor, the constant dragging of routine and the hustle and bustle of life. As the wedding will take place on this lunar day, the destiny of the young family will develop in the future. Therefore, let the wedding feast be bright, interesting, well organized and cheerful.',

      'The period of wisdom, knowledge, spiritual search, and transmission of sacred teachings is favorable for almost any action, if it is performed sincerely and aimed at creation. On the contrary, any conceived negative action is doomed to failure now. This is due to the fact that the deity that rules this period Ganesha is the lord of demons (ganas), hence his name - Ganapati, which literally means - "lord of the ganas. In Indian tradition, Ganesha is also considered the patron saint of poets. So they can count on a barrage of inspiration, as they say, just have time to write it down. It is also a good day for people of science. Today they will certainly come up with an unconventional solution to the problem in front of them. The main thing is to focus all your attention on the task and... "Eureka!" This is a very harmonious time, figuratively speaking, this is the golden mean between the world of the spiritual and the material. Today is the best time to combine creativity and royalties. Astrologers believe that on the twenty-second lunar day, it\'s good to transfer knowledge, adopt the experience of mentors, engage in self-education, attend lectures and go to the library. The 22nd lunar day is also very favorable for travel, pilgrimages, out-of-town trips and business trips, taking vows and making vows. The 22nd Lunar Day - Today you have a chance to learn more than you did in the entire lunar month. All you need to do is not to relax, not to be lazy, but to go firmly towards your intended goal. Your intellectual capacity during this lunar period is fully activated and hungry for new knowledge. If you spend it in passivity, laziness and meaningless pastime, for example, watching TV or playing cards, then the energy of the Moon will be turned against you and you will eventually notice that every day your memory is deteriorating and your ability to concentrate is reduced. This is due to the fact that you have not trained your mental abilities in time, and they, not having received in this lunar period the proper load, simply began to atrophy, because the body was given an order to minimize the activity of this part of your being. Even if you do not learn anything new every day, today it is necessary to make a heroic effort and read at least one scientific book, learn at least one poem, do something that will raise your intellectual level. Today is not the time for thinking. But if you are still drawn to reflection, think about your professional and intellectual development. Maybe it is worth to stay at work and try to do as much as possible: such a productive day in the near future is not expected. But if your work involves physical and nervous tension, on the contrary, it is better to rest. Dedicate your leisure to intellectual pursuits, at least crossword puzzles. But better read something informative, for example, historical or popular scientific literature. As already mentioned, the twenty-second lunar day is favorable not only for learning, but also for passing on your baggage of knowledge to others.

      "The 23rd lunar day is highly energetic. It is filled to the limit with activity as well as aggression. If on the 23rd lunar day, you allow yourself even a second to be passive or inert, then the rapid flow of energy will simply crush you. However, you need to be clear: only your outer life should be active, but inside it's better to stay calm. It's like at a horse race: the faster the horse gallops, the calmer the rider must remain. The 23rd Lunar Day - The energy flows of this lunar day are highly unstable. Therefore, there is a high probability of immoral actions, robberies and murders. For this reason it is highly recommended to avoid crowded places like stadiums, discos and so on. The more people gather, the more unpredictable their behavior becomes. It seems that on the 23rd lunar day it's as if people themselves are asking for quarrels, conflicts and scandals. The fact is that the aura is subjected to a very powerful vibrational influence from the lunar energy flows. And since most people's energy structure is not brought into harmony and is not constantly trained, there is an overload effect, i.e. the energy shell cannot cope with the powerful energetic null radiated by the Moon. Figuratively speaking, one's fuses \"blow,\" and one becomes unmanageable. The energy simply tears him from the inside, looking for a way out and finding it in various conflict situations. By the way, those who practice yoga, qigong, reiki, shamanism do not have such things happening, because their energy field is regularly trained in receiving and transforming more and more powerful energy flows. For them, the 23rd lunar day passes calmly, without various excesses and mishaps. All of their energy is directed in the right direction. But what about all the others who don't have a trained energy field? The right thing to do would be to direct the energy of the 23rd lunar day to solve urgent problems, especially those that require a lot of effort. Remember, don't you have any cases that you can't get off the ground in any way? With the energy of the Moon today, if you use it in the right way, you can overcome even the most hopeless situation. The main thing is not to waste the power given by the Moon on conflicts and quarrels, but to direct it in the right place. On this day, it is better to talk less and do more. All conversations that are not directly related to any important issues will turn into banal gossip. Such gossiping, in turn, will lead to a loss of energy stability. The more you talk, the higher the chance of getting into a scandal. Try to behave as the symbol of this day, the crocodile, behaves on the hunt. At first glance, it seems slow, even a little phlegmatic, but it is extremely collected. As soon as his prey appears, he acts not just swiftly, but lightning-fast and very precisely. Follow his example: be focused and concentrated. Use this lunar interval of time exclusively to solve important problems, to do the most necessary things. In short, don't waste your time on trifles. Tibetan astrologers believe that the 23rd lunar day is one of the most favorable periods to start building and getting support from outside. If on the 23rd lunar day you lose some things, try to accept this fact with joy, because you are losing only what you don't need anymore, what is holding back your development. If you in such a case begin to panic and get upset, you may have worse situations. Remember: \"The place is not empty. If you are deprived of something, it means that there is room for something new. You must swim against the current in your thoughts. Everybody gets mad - you smile, everybody gets upset - you're cool, everybody accuses you of mortal sins - you don't feel any guilt. This approach to reality is essential. Most of us on the 23rd lunar day are at the mercy of our \"inner demons\" and unwittingly do a lot of stupid things. Quiet, but troublesome activities such as housework - cleaning, laundry, small repairs - are suitable for this day. Along with cleaning, it is also good to perform the magical cleansing of the house, which we mentioned in the description of the 14th day. You shouldn't go shopping - there are too many people there. You could suddenly lose confidence in yourself and in the correctness of your actions. This means that you are the victim of an energy vampire. Someone has tapped into the source of your life forces. In this case, gather all your remaining willpower in your fist in order to ... smile and keep calm. Everything passes, and this day, too, will someday end.",

      "A day of deep knowledge, wisdom and prophecy, concentration. Awakening of higher psychic abilities. Good day for traveling and travel, moving, trade and judicial affairs, sleep and rest. Encounters are favorable. Meetings with friends and associates, relatives and representatives of the opposite sex will bring joy. The 25th lunar day is a passive, contemplative day, a period of solitude. The motto of this day can be made Georgy Vitsin's words from his last interview. When asked what he would like to wish the readers of the newspaper, he said: \"Don't make a fuss, people.\" On this lunar day one should not be in a hurry, one should be thorough and unhurried. Not without reason, the symbol of the twenty-fifth lunar day is the turtle. So, during this short period, a man should resemble a turtle - think over his step several times, weigh the pros and cons and only then make a movement. The twenty-fifth lunar day - the time of thoroughness, finding peace, in a sense, it is necessary \"to lay low and stay down. As V. Vysotsky sang: \"Lay low, like a submarine, so that they could not be traced. As a rule, astrologers advise devoting the 25th lunar day to inner problems, to sort out one's self, to reflect on one's character traits, to take stock of one's inner spiritual life. It is a time of relaxation and, in a sense, reflection. But for all the contemplation of this lunar day, there is a danger in it - to understand one's true self should not turn into a self-deprecation and self-humiliation. It is necessary to be as objective as possible about yourself. After all, your spiritual quest concerns only you and no one else. There is no need to work in public today, everything must be intimate and sincere. Without such periods of inner seclusion, you can never know for sure whether you are living moving forward in your development or just constantly running away from yourself. The main purpose of the twenty-fifth lunar day is to gain the ability to love yourself, and that means not inflating your ego, not narcissistic narcissism, but accepting yourself for who you are, with all your pluses and minuses. Tibetan astrologers believe that the twenty-fifth lunar day is favorable for travel, various kinds of trips, business trips, and so on. It is believed that everyone who goes on a trip now, will certainly be accompanied by good luck, but only if the traveler will not be in a hurry. The Tibetan School of Astrology also believes that funeral rituals and ceremonies can be performed on the 25th lunar day.

Problems arising on this lunar day should be solved not so much by reason and by logical reflection, but by trusting your intuition. In particular, this applies to money, because, according to esoteric teachings, money is associated with the element of water. If on the 25th day of the Moon you will have a failure, for example, a deal goes bad, or your finances are "lost" - don\'t worry. It\'s just that your sphere is naturally ridding itself of "material waste", preparing a place for new income. As a rule, what went away today returns doubled, if not tripled. But only on condition that you take it calmly.',
    dreams:
      'Because the twenty-fifth lunar day is associated with water, it is also associated with the depths of the subconscious mind.

Most dreams of the twenty-fifth lunar day do not even require allegorical interpretation, all symbols are quite definite and specific. If the images remain unclear, then listen to your intuition - it will prompt you the right interpretation. Do not try to decompose Dreams on the shelves, do not try to "logically dissect" them necessarily, today only intuition is true, trust it.',

One of the calmest and brightest days of the entire lunar month, the essence of which lies in its symbol, the lotus, which represents the spiritual growth of man. This image shows that everything done during this period on spiritual search will end successfully, because the Lord God Himself blesses such deeds. The twenty-eighth lunar day is the period of spiritual maturing and gaining wisdom. The lunar month is almost completely lived through, and everyone has changed. Those who followed lunar rhythms, who moved in unison with the Moon, gain the mercy of the Night Goddess. The 28th lunar day can truly be recognized by its fruits. Everything planted on the previous lunar days will sprout today. Therefore, the motto of the period is "What you sow, you reap. Everything you planted on the previous lunar days will sprout today. If you experience unpleasant events, don\'t consider them unexpected: they are the quite expected result of your negative actions during the whole lunar month. If during the whole lunar month you have been doing everything right and today the first fruits of your previous actions have appeared, first of all, you should accept them in joy, but not in idleness. You shouldn\'t shower the first sprout of success that shows itself to the point of losing control, otherwise the victory will end there. Secondly, when the first fruit appears, try not to slow down, do not relax, on the contrary, gather your strength and do it, do it, do it ... Thirdly, when acting, do not put pressure on the situation, keep the same pace, do not try to gain even more momentum. This will only lead to a complete collapse, because this or that situation for its logical and successful completion must have a certain tempo, a certain vibration of realization, and if this tempo is broken, then a "stumble" situation will occur, and the result may not be what was expected (if at all in this case it will be). The 28th lunar day invariably brings success in business. Travelling on the 28th day is a good thing: feel free to go on a journey, you will have new experiences. All astrological schools of thought consider it favorable for practically everything and, naturally, for spiritual matters in the first place. Direct your thought flight to the Universe, try to establish an imaginary connection with the Cosmos. Think of everything at once, of a single world. Catch the wave of world harmony and stay on it. Optimally combine creative and contemplative activities, such as unhurried work in the garden. Plant flowers and admire their beauty. The 28th lunar day prohibits all destructive actions. On the same garden plot one should not tear, dig up and uproot anything. Even the flowers on this day, it is better not to give gifts: in this case, you will also become involved in destruction. Fans of hunting and fishing can responsibly declare: this is not your day! A favorable day, the day of the Sun, on which spiritual insights and alchemy of the soul are possible. A person in a dream or in the process of meditation cognizes his past births. A period of comprehension of higher truths, acquiring spiritual creation, a day of contemplation of all chakras and work with them.

      "The 29th lunar day has a rather bad reputation. And this is not accidental, because it is the heaviest day of the whole lunar cycle. Many esoteric schools even call this day \"satanic\". The fact is that its energy is so powerful that most people simply can't cope with it. As a rule, the twenty-ninth lunar day completes the lunar cycle. The 30th lunar day in the lunar month is not always, and even if it is, it lasts for a very short time. So, in fact, the 29th lunar day is the finale of the lunar month. It should be kept in mind that on the 29th lunar day, the probability of various kinds of conflicts and quarrels increases greatly. And if you don't catch it in time, acute situations can escalate into hostile relationships for years to come. On this day, any carelessly thrown word you can perceive as a blood feud, and you will have only one question: \"How to get revenge?\" The Octopus is not without reason the symbol of this lunar day: with its tentacles of negative thoughts and emotions it will wrap your whole consciousness, so try not to lose control over yourself, otherwise your whole life will be subordinated to one purpose - to inflict even greater offence on your offenders. On the 29th lunar day you should be especially restrained and careful. Be tolerant of other people's shortcomings, do not react too violently to outbursts in your direction. Forgive your abusers: this is the best thing you can do on the 29th lunar day to avoid tense and conflicting situations. During this period, you should avoid walking in unfortunate areas of town, do not walk in dark streets, and do not believe any offers from strangers: any situation can turn into a tragedy. The 29th lunar day has the highest percentage of accidents and incidents. That is why you should be especially careful when crossing the street and driving a car. However, for all the danger of this period, do not dwell on its negative aspects. Excessive feelings of fear, doubt, and doom are dangers in themselves. We can avoid many unpleasant situations if we change our attitude to the events. We just need to take everything with humor and irony. You don't have to take everything to heart. He who will pass the 29th lunar day with dignity will enter the new lunar cycle refreshed and changed. The Lunar Goddess will bestow her mercy and blessing upon such a person. On the 29th lunar day, direct the flight of your thought to the Universe, try to establish an imaginary connection with the Cosmos. Think of everything at once, of one world. Catch the wave of world harmony and hold on to it. Optimally combine creative and contemplative activities, such as unhurried work in the garden. Plant flowers and admire their beauty. On the twenty-ninth lunar day, you must not take any active measures and especially not to start any new business. Any case initiated on this day is doomed not only to failure, but to a total collapse. Also, you should not finish any projects or activities today. If you do this, then the work of many days, months or years will be wasted. Why cross out something that has cost you a lot of effort? Try to limit your contact with people as much as possible, or better yet, cancel meetings altogether. The less contact you will have on this day, the more chances you have to avoid problems in the future. If you are forced to communicate, remember that the 29th lunar day is fraught with betrayal. You may be called into a confessional relationship with the express purpose of using it to your advantage. Even your close friends with whom, as they say, you have eaten a lot of salt, can cause you a lot of trouble. On this day, astrologers recommend you to be mistrustful. Always check questionable numbers and facts. Do not believe all kinds of predictions: they are unlikely to come true. The time for travel and business trips is not suitable at all. It is better to spend this period alone and devote it to creativity, then you will get good results. Tibetan astrological tradition advises to refrain from funeral ceremonies and rituals, as well as from a wake. It is believed that such procedures attract different kinds of malicious entities from the afterlife, because on this lunar day they are very active and it won't be difficult for them to go to our world. In general, it should be noted that the twenty-ninth lunar day is the time of unclean powers.",
